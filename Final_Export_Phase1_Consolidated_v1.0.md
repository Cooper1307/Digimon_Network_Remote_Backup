# Digimon Network: The Raiders

## Preface

This work is an original fan-fiction based on the *DIGIMON* series. It can be understood as a story where humans assume the roles of Digimon to embark on network adventures. The setting utilizes a fused worldview and excludes supernatural elements such as X-Antibody or Hybrids. The narrative alternates between the "Main Story" and "Side Stories," spanning a total of nine volumes. The "Upper Volume" covers the first four parts, the "Middle Volume" encompasses the fifth, and the "Lower Volume" comprises the final four. The Main Story follows the journey of the lead heroine, while the Side Stories provide perspectives from other characters (excluding Guild Leaders) to expand on secondary plotlines.

The setting is a near-future era where humanity has established a new login hub in the Digital World known as **Midgard**. Time in Midgard flows identically to the Digital World: one day there is roughly equivalent to one minute in reality, meaning four years in Midgard equate to a single day in our world. Originally created as a platform for professionals to identify and resolve network issues within the Digital World, it was eventually promoted to the public, evolving into a massive, live-action interactive experience system. Anyone can easily access it by purchasing an EDEN sensory immersion rig.

To prevent an influx of users from disrupting the natural lives of resident Digimon and triggering cybersecurity incidents, developers implemented a mandatory protocol: all users passing through the network firewalls at Midgard are forcibly transformed into the Digimon avatar they selected within their respective Guilds. Each user is limited to a single Digimon bond. Initially, users may only choose a Digimon in its Rookie stage (selection constitutes joining the corresponding Guild). All user avatars are equipped with an "Experience Medal"—a chip the size of a fingernail, typically embedded within the body—to distinguish them from genuine Digimon. By touching a target's body, if the chip glows red, the individual is a human avatar; if there is no reaction, they are a true Digimon.

Based on different types of Digimon, ten Great Guilds have been established in Midgard:

- **The Order of Holy Knights** (神圣骑士团)
- **The Underworld Club** (幽冥俱乐部)
- **The Mutation Research Institute** (突变研究所)
- **Atlantis** (亚特兰蒂斯)
- **The "Drink" Bar** (喝一杯酒吧)
- **The Iron Legion** (钢铁雄兵)
- **The Sylvan Garden** (自然庭院)
- **The Dragon's Den** (御龙巢穴)
- **The Beast King's Fangs** (兽皇之牙)
- **The Wind-Chasing Brigade** (追风旅团)

Every two years, each Guild hosts an internal "Guild War" where members face off in PK matches. The final victor is awarded a "Seed of Ascension" by official authorities. Once consumed, it allows for a partial expansion of the user's data, manifesting as an evolution or form change that lasts for up to 600 seconds (ten minutes) before the user reverts to their previous state. Additionally, those who defeat their Guild Master receive extra rewards.

All characters appearing in this work are adults, making this a narrative that leans away from younger audiences. The entire story was drafted with the full chapter structure in mind; therefore, there is no risk of a "bad ending" or the story being abandoned due to a lack of content. You may read with peace of mind.

Lastly, I wish you all a pleasant reading experience.

## Milestone 1: Prologue & Chapter 1

### Prologue: The Raiders

Humanity’s quest to explore the Digital World knows no end.

In the physical world, the network is the lifeblood of existence. But a network requires maintenance; maintenance demands the detection of flaws, and flaws demand resolution. Such is the cycle of human necessity. Yet, identifying these fissures is no simple feat. The digital realm is far more intricate than we dare imagine—lacking physical substance, its most critical clues often elude the naked eye, spiraling into lethal catastrophes. Even with our mastery over code, we cannot wait for data to self-correct. Human intervention remains our only true safeguard.

Then, one day, an esteemed academic proposed a radical hypothesis: If every digital event is a reflection of local reality, why not strike at the root? By plunging directly into the Digital World to uproot the cause, wouldn't the glitches in our physical realm dissolve of their own accord?

I countered him immediately. "How do you know the intruder won't become the next catastrophe? If our presence adds unnecessary strain to that space—forget whether the original glitch can even be localized—whether your agent can even survive the return is a gamble. To say nothing of the ripple effects that would follow."

After a grueling debate, the consensus sided with him. They argued we must look toward the future; that while risks were inevitable, they were obstacles meant to be overcome.

Five years later, Midgard rose.

Ten years later, the EDEN sensory immersion rigs became a household standard.

And then, the world finally tasted the cruelty of the Digital World—especially in those uncharted territories beyond human reach. To die there was to be shredded into raw data, leaving nothing behind.

From alpha tests to open beta, and finally to full operation, I bore witness to the birth of the Guilds. I watched as wave after wave of pioneers breached the network firewalls, assuming the forms of Digimon only to march toward their deaths on the far side. Many vanished without a whisper. A part of me believes I failed them—that their silence is a burden I must carry. Perhaps if I had won that debate years ago, there would be more happy families in this world today.

Perhaps this entire endeavor was a mistake from the beginning—a problem in its own right. And so, I became the one to solve it.

I founded **The Raiders**.

They were drafted by nation-state, elected from the elite of the major Guilds. The minimum requirement for entry was the Mega Level. Guild Leaders were excluded, for a flock of dragons must never be without its head. Through rigorous multi-layered screenings, each nation selected a single representative for The Raiders. This was done for two reasons: equity and security.

Before every excursion into the unknown, I sought their consent. Or more accurately, I sought the blessing of their superiors. If their governments deemed them expendable, I had no voice to object.

With every raid, I tasked them with retrieving data samples. These allowed me to analyze the environment, construct predictive topographical models, and assess threat levels to ensure the next party’s survival.

To date, twenty nations have joined the cause. Within the unit, two factions have already emerged: The "U.N. Big Five" and the "Nordic Five." I was told this was the will of their respective governments. I had no power to interfere, nor the desire to. In truth, I found it fitting. To brave the abyss with comrades bound by absolute trust—it was a dream I once held myself. They realized it for me, and their results have been nothing short of extraordinary.

These small units operate in teams of five, fulfilling specific roles: **Vanguard, Support, Striker, Defender, and Backup.** Their coordination is surgical, and so far, every mission has proceeded without a hitch.

That is all I can share for now. Indeed, that is all they permit me to say.

Oh, one last thing. Before they departed, they asked me to leave a message for everyone logging in for the first time:

**"Welcome to the Digital World."**

### Chapter 1: The Ebon Hero

My mother passed away unexpectedly, leaving me without my only remaining kin.

In her will—penned while she yet lived—she transferred her Midgard account to my name. It had been active for less than seventy-two hours in the physical world, yet she hoped it would offer me solace in her stead, keeping the shroud of loneliness at bay.

I set aside my research papers, requested leave from my advisor, and departed Tokyo for my long-forsaken hometown of Kyoto. Everything remained exactly as I remembered it. My neighbors were waiting for me; they helped arrange the mortician and saw to my mother’s final rites.

"How did she die?" I asked.

"We don't know," my neighbor replied. "The police said it appeared to be sudden cardiac arrest."

Sudden death? How absurd a way to go—not even granted a final glimpse of the world.

After saying my final goodbyes, I went to her room to settle her affairs. Tucked beneath her pillow, I found a diary. It was a record of her past—most of it chronicling her adventures in Midgard, where she had assumed the form of a Digimon.

"Lalamon... Woodmon... Lilamon..."

I whispered the names one by one. From her beginnings as a Rookie to her ascent to the Ultimate level, the pages were a testament to her long struggle.

Through her entries, I began to understand her life within Midgard. She had been a member of the **Sylvan Garden Guild** and had forged a pact with a user named Snake: whoever could evolve their Lilamon into its Mega level first would earn the right to campaign for the position of the next Guild Master.

*“A day in the Digital World equals a minute in reality.”*

If that rule held true, she had been immersed in that world for at least ten years. According to her diary, a decade was more than enough time for a Digimon to climb from the Rookie stage to the Mega level. If one were diligent and took on enough guild commissions, eight or nine years would suffice. In other words, this "Snake" had surely already secured the right to the candidacy—perhaps they were already the Guild Master.

I inherited my mother’s fierce competitive streak. Knowing her, had she still been alive, she never would have let Snake best her. A surge of indignation rose within me. I decided then and there to find Snake and settle the score.

Following the clues left on the final page of the diary, I climbed into the attic of our old house. I waded through a mountain of junk shrouded in plastic until I finally unearthed her EDEN sensory immersion rig. It looked remarkably new, free of dust; she couldn't have used it for long.

I pulled out the manual, connected the power, and inserted the authentication card she had prepared for me. Once the system verified my identity, a sudden flash of light blinded me. By the time I regained my senses, my body had already transitioned into a completely new space.

Clicking the button on the left, I felt a sudden surge of power propel me forward, merging my consciousness into the data stream. The journey was faster than a rocket; in the blink of an eye, I had successfully logged into the Midgard system and arrived at this vast tourist hub.

The transition left me disoriented.

Once the ground felt solid beneath my feet, I surveyed my surroundings. Despite its name, Midgard was essentially an endless plaza. At its center stood a towering data wall—a network firewall designed to separate the external network of the Digital World from the hub.

"Up for an adventure, beautiful?"

A man with a thick Kansai accent brushed past me. I ignored him, silently stepping aside to give him room. I watched his form as he breached the data wall. At first, a chaotic swirl of data enveloped him, which he gradually absorbed until it became a part of his very being. When a golden ring of data surged upward through his frame, he was transformed in an instant into a Leomon.

Steeling my resolve, I followed his lead. I moved toward the data wall, tentatively nudging my body through the barrier.

The change was immediate. My hair shortened, thinning into strands of vibrant green, while a massive pink blossom erupted from my back. The air was suddenly thick with the scent of lilacs, and a strange weightlessness took hold of me. But then, as a radiant circuit of code ascended from my feet, I felt a searing heat ignite within. My limbs locked, immovable, as a kaleidoscope of data symbols collided and overlapped before my eyes.

"AAAAAAAUUUUGHHHH!"

The sensation was intolerable. I screamed—a raw, visceral sound. It felt as though ten thousand hands were wielding ten thousand razors, flaying the very skin from my body. The only constant was my heart, radiating a defiant heat from the inside out.

"What... what is happening?"

By the time I realized my body was warping, it was already too late. Every process, authorized or otherwise, was executing simultaneously. My stature shot upward; my limbs grew long and slender; my waist narrowed as my curves filled out. Two thick brambles erupted from my core, winding tightly around my torso and arms. The thorns dug in, constricting my chest until even breathing became a struggle.

**Lilamon, Mega Digivolutions—to Rosemon!**

The sudden, inexplicable evolution left me reeling. I stood frozen in place, my mind struggling to process the transition.

"Beautiful, get out of the way!"

A booming voice rang out behind me. I stammered an apology and scrambled to clear the path. "I'm sorry! This is my first time... I'm still adjusting..."

Before me stood a **MirageGaogamon**. Unlike the standard variety, he wore a cape emblazoned with the South Korean flag. Judging by his gear, he was undoubtedly a representative of the Korean Raiders.

"Fixed-point transport system initiated. Old coordinates discarded. New coordinates confirmed. Transfer beginning in ten... nine... eight..."

I watched as he vanished into a specialized transport stream. Once I was sure no one was watching, the embarrassment began to fade, replaced by a growing sense of awe. I found a patch of ice on the ground and peered at my reflection.

I was beyond satisfied. I had transformed from a cute girl into a literal goddess. I stood there, mesmerized by my own reflection, unable to pull myself away.

---

Blissfully ignorant, I stepped through the data wall into the outer world. My attention was entirely fixed on my new self—until I realized I had wandered into a dense forest and was quite "gloriously" lost.

Glancing back, the data wall was still visible, its surface scrolling with mundane social news from the Digital World. It was all the same nonsense: one tribe declaring war on another over a stolen turnip; another group swimming straight into a Whamon’s mouth; or a "rebel human faction" being infiltrated and pummeled by pro-human operatives in Digimon forms. Things that would be scandals in the human world were just everyday trivia here.

*I know where the data wall is,* I told myself. *As long as I keep my bearings, I’ll be fine. I might as well explore a bit before heading back to the guild to find Snake.*

But I had underestimated the forest. The bizarre, twisted trees soon blurred into a confusing maze, and within minutes, the towering data wall was gone. I was utterly lost. Disoriented, I stumbled through the gloom, making no progress toward an exit. Instead, I succeeded only in getting hit squarely on the head by a piece of falling fruit.

"Ow... that really hurts..."

I was clutching my head, rolling on the ground in pain, when a face appeared above me, clearly having waited for some time. It was a face that could only be described as loathsome. His teeth were a stained, sickly yellow; dark sunglasses masked his eyes; a WaruMonzaemon plush dangled from his waist. With a rose clenched in his teeth and a microphone in hand, he belted out a tune that was pure acoustic torture. He was the absolute embodiment of the word "greasy."

"Does my lady have a headache?" he asked, his voice dripping with mock-concern. "Or perhaps... you are simply dazed by my beauty?"

I slapped him. Forgive me—I couldn't help it.

But the result was not what I expected. Despite the full force of my blow, he didn't even flinch. He didn’t show a hint of pain or even an acknowledgment of the insult. Instead, he grinned wider, leaning in closer. "Oh, poor thing. Does your hand hurt? Do you need me to rub it for you?"

"Get away from me!" I scrambled back, clutching my chest to guard myself.

"Ooh, a feisty one. I like that." He snapped his fingers and gave a theatrical, mock-gentlemanly bow. "I trust my **'Love Serenade'** was to your liking? If not, I can always treat you to a **'Dark Solo'**. I guarantee you’ll be falling for me in no time."

"No, no! I’m good!" I stammered, desperation rising. "Who... who are you?"

"Ah, how rude of me. I forgot to introduce myself. I am **MetalEtemon**, member of the **Pervert Guild** and its most refined gentleman. And might I ask the name of my lovely lady?"

"Just call me Sakura," I managed to say.

"Sakura?" He stroked his chin, pondering the name. "Elegant yet common, common yet elegant. A fine name!"

He snapped his fingers and started toward me. I barked at him to stop. "Don't come any closer! Or I'll—I'll—!"

I wanted to say 'call for help,' but the forest was suffocatingly dense. No one would hear me. I bit back the threat and tried to use my wits instead. "Could you... could you maybe sing something a bit softer? We girls don't really like all that shouting."

He seemed to consider this, turning away for a moment of reflection. I seized the chance, scrambled to my feet, and—dignity be damned—dove into a hollow tree, crawled out the other side, and bolted.

"Oh—oh-oh-oh-oh!"

He was swinging through the trees on vines, closing the gap in seconds. I didn't dare look back.

"Running is~ use~ less~!"

Running was all I had. I would rather die than fall into the hands of a freak like him. But my luck ran out. My heel caught on a root, and I went sprawling. As he climbed down from a tree, cursing under his breath, he lunged forward, grabbed my ankle, and hoisted me into the air, dangling me upside down.

"Good girls shouldn't lie."

I aimed my free leg at his face and kicked with everything I had. It was like kicking a stone wall; he didn't even budge. He sighed, shook his head, and then—to my horror—turned his backside toward me and unleashed a **'Poop Gas'** attack. The stench was nearly fatal. Had I not been a Mega-level plant Digimon with natural air-purifying properties, I would have passed out on the spot.

"Feeling refreshed, are we?"

I didn't answer. I lashed out with the **'Thorn Whip'** wrapped around my arm, striking him across the rear. Instead of pain, he seemed to enjoy it, thrusting his backside out further and demanding I hit harder.

"You really are a pervert!"

"I’ll take that as a compliment!"

I was lost in a world I didn't understand. Even with Rosemon’s body, I had no idea how to use my skills, leaving me at the mercy of this monster. I struggled, but his patience was wearing thin.

"Little darling~" He crooned, a nickname that made my skin crawl. "I’ve been letting you have your fun, but you kept trying to play me for a fool. Now... it’s my turn to get angry."

He unleashed his **'World's Strongest Punch'** straight into my solar plexus.

Consciousness fled. I was sent flying like a discarded doll, bouncing between trunks and roots before crashing into a shallow pit. He wasn't finished. He stood over my broken form, urinated on me, and then leapt high for a **'Full Metal Hip Attack'**. The impact crushed my waist, pinning me into the dirt.

---

"Ah, no movement. It’s over then. Time to bring you back for the boys to play with for a few days..."

He chuckled, his fingers tightening around my throat as he hoisted me off the ground once more. He leaned in, his tongue flicking out for a disgusting lick against my cheek. But before he could savor it, the distant roar of an explosion made him shiver in fright.

"What was that!?" He freed one hand to scratch his head, muttering to himself. "We agreed to split up, bag the prey, and rendezvous. Why the explosions? Is this some new kink the guys are working on? I really can’t keep up with them."

Then, as if struck by a terrifying thought, his expression hardened into one of cold calculation. He began to study me—his "prey"—with renewed scrutiny. "Wait... did the objective change? It shouldn't have, unless something happened to the main force. Hmm... the Raiders *have* been awfully active lately. It’s not impossible we’ve run into them. Tsk. Such a shame to waste a flower like this... What are you exactly? A giant rose? Ah, right. That’s it. Bye-bye, beautiful. I’ve got to find my partners. If I can't have you, no one will!"

The intent was clear: he was going to destroy me.

He bared his teeth, his chest swelling with a renewed, manic fighting spirit. One hand remained clamped like a vise around my throat while the other reached toward the heavens. He roared the name of his finishing move:

**"Giga Blaster: Deadly Ray!"**

A surge of thick, black lightning cascaded from the heavens, engulfing my entire frame and pinning me in place. The pressure soon pierced my skin, shattering the **Trial Badge** mounted beneath my collarbone. My body began to digitize. In that moment, the pain vanished, replaced only by a strange, hollow sense of relief—the same peace I saw on my mother’s face during her final rites.

Beside me, the pervert known as Yamao Oochiku wore a grotesque smile, a mix of sadistic joy and mock-regret. His dark sunglasses hid his eyes, but for a split second, I wondered if he would look different without them. Perhaps he wouldn't look so much like a monster—even if that’s exactly what he was.

Seconds? Minutes? I couldn't tell. Then, a black disc whistled out of the forest shadows. It sliced through the lightning descending from above, richocheted off a tree trunk, and struck the hand crushing my throat. The pain made him howl, and his grip finally failed.

"AAAAAAGHHH! What the hell was that!? That hurts!"

I focused my eyes. It was a pitch-black **Brave Shield**. My heart skipped a beat. If the rumors were true, its owner was a **BlackWarGreymon**. But this shield was different—it bore the unmistakable engraving of the **Crest of Courage**.

"Hahaha!" MetalEtemon barked, clutching his forehead as he laughed. "Trying that old trick on me? Don't you know I'm the King of Digimon, forged from **Chrome Digizoid**? There’s a limit to how much a sneak attack can do!"

Before he could finish his boast, a black cyclone erupted from the depths of the forest, striking like a massive drill and sending the monkey spiraling into the air. He had expected to land gracefully, to strike a pose that proved his absolute toughness. But reality hit him harder. He fell like a stone, and as he hit the ground, I saw it: a gaping, jagged hole torn clean through his "indestructible" metal body.

"How... how is possible...? This is Chrome Digizoid... it shouldn't... be so easily..."

"I'm made of it too," a cold voice replied.

With his Digicore shattered, the silver ape dissolved into a cloud of data dust, carried away by the wind.

The owner of the shield retrieved his weapon, locking it back into place on his back. His dark silhouette flickered within the shadows of the trees, the **Dramon Killers** mounted on his arms glinting with a cold, metallic light. Everything about him screamed that he was the hero who had saved me from that nightmare.

He approached me, disarming his weapons and kneeling on one knee, like a knight coming to his queen's rescue.

"Are you okay?" he asked.

"Not really..." I managed to breathe. "Who are you?"

"BlackWarGreymon. No need for thanks."

"Ah... thank you for that... but I meant your name."

He paused for two seconds, contemplating the question.

"**Owl**," he replied. "And you?"

"Just call me Sakura."

"Don't move," he said, his tone turning serious. "You're badly hurt. I must take you back for treatment immediately."

"Back... back?" I asked, my voice growing fainter as my strength ebbed away. "Where... where are we going?"

At the question, he seemed to falter for a second before quickly adding, "Don't worry about that. It’s a good place. That is... if you trust me."

He was being foolish. Why wouldn't a fallen queen trust the very knight who had come to her rescue?

"Okay," I whispered with a weary nod. "Then I'll leave it to you."
