# Digimon Network: The Raiders

## Final Consolidated Volume (Phases 1-5)

---

## Preface

This work is an original fan-fiction based on the *DIGIMON* series. It can be understood as a story where humans assume the roles of Digimon to embark on network adventures. The setting utilizes a fused worldview and excludes supernatural elements such as X-Antibody or Hybrids. The narrative alternates between the "Main Story" and "Side Stories," spanning a total of nine volumes. The "Upper Volume" covers the first four parts, the "Middle Volume" encompasses the fifth, and the "Lower Volume" comprises the final four. The Main Story follows the journey of the lead heroine, while the Side Stories provide perspectives from other characters (excluding Guild Leaders) to expand on secondary plotlines.

The setting is a near-future era where humanity has established a new login hub in the Digital World known as **Midgard** (also referred to as the **Atrium** in later chapters). Time in Midgard flows identically to the Digital World: one day there is roughly equivalent to one minute in reality, meaning four years in Midgard equate to a single day in our world. Originally created as a platform for professionals to identify and resolve network issues within the Digital World, it was eventually promoted to the public, evolving into a massive, live-action interactive experience system. Anyone can easily access it by purchasing an EDEN sensory immersion rig.

To prevent an influx of users from disrupting the natural lives of resident Digimon and triggering cybersecurity incidents, developers implemented a mandatory protocol: all users passing through the network firewalls at Midgard are forcibly transformed into the Digimon avatar they selected within their respective Guilds. Each user is limited to a single Digimon bond. Initially, users may only choose a Digimon in its Rookie stage (selection constitutes joining the corresponding Guild). All user avatars are equipped with an "Trial Badge"—a chip the size of a fingernail, typically embedded within the body—to distinguish them from genuine Digimon. By touching a target's body, if the chip glows red, the individual is a human avatar; if there is no reaction, they are a true Digimon.

Based on different types of Digimon, ten Great Guilds have been established in Midgard:

- **Order of Holy Knights** (神圣骑士团)
- **Nether Club** (幽冥俱乐部)
- **Mutant Research Lab** (突变研究所)
- **Atlantis** (亚特兰蒂斯)
- **Drink a Glass Bar** (喝一杯酒吧)
- **Steel Legions** (钢铁雄兵)
- **Sylvan Garden** (自然庭院)
- **Imperial Dragon's Nest** (御龙巢穴)
- **Beast King's Fangs** (兽皇之牙)
- **Wind-Chasing Brigade** (追风旅团)

Every two years, each Guild hosts an internal "Guild War" where members face off in PK matches. The final victor is awarded a "Seed of Ascension" by official authorities. Once consumed, it allows for a partial expansion of the user's data, manifesting as an evolution or form change that lasts for up to 600 seconds (ten minutes) before the user reverts to their previous state. Additionally, those who defeat their Guild Master receive extra rewards.

All characters appearing in this work are adults, making this a narrative that leans away from younger audiences. The entire story was drafted with the full chapter structure in mind; therefore, there is no risk of a "bad ending" or the story being abandoned due to a lack of content. You may read with peace of mind.

Lastly, I wish you all a pleasant reading experience.
