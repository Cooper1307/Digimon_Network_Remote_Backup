{{ CHECKPOINT 4 }}
# USER Objective:
Execute Phase 3: Chapters 3, Gaiden 1, 4, and 5 Automation

The user's main objective is to initiate and automate Phase 3 of the "Digital Monster Network" project. This phase covers Chapter 3, Gaiden 1, Chapter 4, and Chapter 5. This involves applying the AIE v3.0 protocols, maintaining "Tone Sovereignty" (Mature/Adult/Dark Fantasy), and ensuring "Logic Consistency."

# Previous Session Summary (Phase 2 Closure & Phase 3 Initialization):
Phase 2 (Chapter 2) has been officially SEALED and ARCHIVED. 
Phase 3 has been initialized with the following alignment:
1.  **Chapter 3 and Gaiden 1**: Already processed and categorized under `Phase3` directories.
2.  **Structural Integrity**: Verified all project files and directories are aligned with the new scope.
3.  **Database Synchronization**: `Database_Phase2_v1.0.md` is complete and verified. (Note: Should be archived at the start of Phase 3 work).

# Next Steps:
1.  **Initialize Phase 3 Framework**: 
    - Archive `Database_Phase2_v1.0.md` to `Database/Archive/`.
    - Create `Database_Phase3_v1.0.md`.
2.  **Verify Chapters 3 & Gaiden 1**: 
    - Perform a quick context audit of the existing Phase 3 files.
3.  **Process Chapters 4 & 5**:
    - Locate Chapter 4 & 5 in `中译英原文《数码兽网络：攻略组》（上）.md`.
    - Execute Module A-D Pipeline (Lore-Scan, MTPE Analysis, Clean Export).
4.  **Update Progress**:
    - Update `task.md` for Phase 3 expansion.
    - Log actions in `AIE_Project_Edit_Log_v1.0.md`.

Please start by archiving the Phase 2 database and initializing the new Phase 3 database for the expanded scope.
