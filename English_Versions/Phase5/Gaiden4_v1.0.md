# Side Story IV: Subjugation of Plutomon (外传四：普路托兽讨伐战)

## (Part 1)

**-By Agnes-**

My father arranged a blind date for me. I didn't want to go, afraid I wouldn't find any common topics with the guy. Just as I was looking for an excuse to decline, an excuse found its way to me.

The person who contacted me was the younger sister of my first boyfriend, Aurelie Lefebvre, who was also my senior in university. She reached out to me as the representative of the French [Raiders], trying to convince me to help her investigate a certain person. Originally, she wanted to go through the formal process and report it to the [Raiders] lead for assignment, but the leader was away, so she contacted me first.

"You've come to the right person."

I accepted without a second thought.

"The target likely isn't a friendly character, Agnes. Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?"

"By the time I finish reconsidering, the bird will have flown." I thanked her for her kind warning and told her: "Don't worry, the five Nordic countries are a group; we always act together. If there's a lead, I'll give you an answer immediately."

Hanging up, I ignored my father's persuasion outside the door, shared the news with the representatives of the other four Nordic countries, locked the door, went to the EDEN haptic equipment, wiped off the dust, inserted my ID medal, and logged into the long-lost Atrium system. Sanhara was still as beautiful as ever.

Switching to the form of Valkyrimon, I was about to fly up to find Guild Master Wind and ask about the situation. Just as I was about to move, my companion golden bird "Freya" stopped me, warning me to be alert as something dangerous was approaching.

Hiding behind a massive rock and looking around, I soon saw a Plutomon. He was muttering to himself, full of self-reproach, as if he had just done something wrong to someone.

I followed him all the way, hoping to hear some useful clues from his mouth to save the trouble of disturbing our Guild Master, who loved to pursue freedom and the wind. He seemed to have a screw loose, personally confessing every crime he had committed—including how he used Guild Master Wind's ID medal to log into the Atrium in her identity and played the "Free Birds" and the mediation organization like puppets.

My intuition judged that he was the culprit I was looking for.

So I stepped forward immediately to engage in negotiation; the reason I didn't act immediately was because I still tried to believe that what he had just said was all nonsense. After questioning him once, not only did he not answer a single question, but he turned back and asked me: "Did you hear everything I just said?"

I gave him an affirmative answer. He smiled twice at me, ended with a contemptuous tone, and then stated that I knew too much about him, so he had to silence me and not let me return alive to tell others, even gentlemanly asking me to prepare to be quickly terminated by him.

"Please, is there any point in these empty words?" I said to him disdainfully. "Straight talk: we're both Megas, who are you trying to intimidate?"

The next second, he released a piece of black chaos from behind him, vanished into it, and instantly appeared behind me. Fortunately, with Freya's timely warning, his sneak attack didn't succeed. I made a prompt decision and drew the "Fenrir Sword" hanging on my left waist to counter-attack.

The sword touched his hard body and instantly froze it. But in the blink of an eye, he was swallowed by that clump of black chaos again, then restored to his state before being frozen, reappearing before me.

"Is this all you've got?"

He subjected me to verbal humiliation. As a descendant of the "Valkyrie," how could I tolerate this? So I shot my "Aurvandil's Arrow" at him, which never missed. Little did I expect that he would casually pull over a piece of chaos from behind him, turning it into a shield and blocking it very easily.

It's no exaggeration to say that aside from my best skill in team command, my [Support Position] tricks were exhausted. It's hard to imagine that a person like me would become the captain of the [Five Nordic Countries Raiders]; sometimes, I feel ashamed for myself.

Realizing that my amateur skills weren't enough to take him down alone, I immediately changed my strategy, switching from offense to defense, leading him toward populated areas to create a relatively large commotion and cause a stir, so I could meet up with the others as quickly as possible. If all five of us were present, I doubted he would have the power to turn the tide.

I excelled at speed, so dodging was my forte—little did I know it was also his.

Following me with a relentless pursuit, I didn't gain a single advantage and ended up covered in wounds, often being blasted from the sky to the ground, rolling and crashing into trees and rocks, the scene becoming as pathetic as could be.

Holding my waist and lying on the ground, I gradually realized I might not make it to a populated area, so I intended to turn back and fight to the death, to see whose life was harder.

The results proved that his was harder.

I was beaten to a pulp, with no way to resist. The feathers on my body were continuously burned by the black chaos, and the pain from the skin burns made me scream again and again, but it only made him more excited, more wanting to strip a bird-person like me from the data combination and have my soul completely infected by this dangerous virus, becoming another scourge threatening the Atrium.

Wanting to beg for mercy, but unable to open my mouth.
Wanting to run away, but unable to move my legs.
Falling into such a state, it's no exaggeration to say my life was "in imminent danger." I didn't know if this power of his was innate or obtained through effort; regardless, I could be sure that the black chaos on him absolutely didn't belong to the Atrium—in other words, the Atrium couldn't produce a monster like him.

"Miraculous, right?" He leaned close to my ear and whispered softly: "This black thing has given me power. it cannot be destroyed by your ultimate moves, cannot be cleared as data, and cannot even be identified as a bug by the system. With it, no one is my opponent. Everyone who stands in my way will be swallowed by it, becoming its nourishment and prompting it to continuously supply me with power. And you are but an appetizer; I can tell it to be a bit gentler to you, so you don't go so painfully."

"Does it require me to pay any price?"

"Of course not," he replied quickly. "Erasing your existence is the price."

I felt more and more that even if the five of us gathered, we might not be able to handle him, because that piece of black chaos would always block all fatal damage for him, and sometimes it could even become transparent, appearing unexpectedly and giving you a hard blow from behind, becoming a weapon to plot against you.

"I want to know where you got such a treasure?"

I gritted my teeth and struggled to ask this question. My strength was gradually being sucked away, my spirit became withered, and even the vision before my eyes hadn't escaped the influence, blurring bit by bit.

"Like you, I also want to know."

He told me that back then, to pursue power beyond the mediation organization, he stepped into that barren land in the Digital World and then honorably fainted. When he woke up, he found he possessed this miraculous power.

"...And even completed a stage-skipping evolution."

"Stage-skipping? How... how is that possible?"

"Believe it or not," he said indifferently. "No executioner would lie to a dying person. It... indeed happened, right to me. I also want to figure out what's going on, but unfortunately, there aren't enough talents in the Atrium. Perhaps, at this moment, someone has hidden in their territory and figured it out."

He had ignored one thing from the beginning, and that was why I had fallen to such a state. Logically, in terms of speed, he and I were evenly matched, and it shouldn't lead to a one-sided situation, unless "Freya," the golden bird that always reminded me how to dodge attacks from behind, had been sent out temporarily to perform another task. For example, calling someone, leading the way—and all I had to do was cooperate with it, delay Plutomon, and buy more time for it until my reinforcements arrived.

Hard work pays off; just before my left arm was disabled, the first reinforcement arrived—Sleipmon, the representative from Finland and the [Vanguard Position]. The "Bifrost" was fired from the holy crossbow "Muspelheim" in his left hand, and Plutomon, unable to dodge in time, had to take this hit squarely.

Upon meeting, he sent a greeting gift to our enemy, which not only distracted him but also bought enough time to rescue me. It seems his [Vanguard Position] is quite reliable.

"Go quickly, I've got this."

After saying this, he was knocked aside by Plutomon's "Chaos Light." With the holy shield "Niflheim" on his right arm as a block, the damage he sustained was minimal.

Seeing this, Plutomon naturally wouldn't leave him much room to breathe. After dropping two chaos bombs in quick succession, our vanguard Sleipmon completely disappeared into a patch of chaos. When we saw him again, he had been forced to use his hidden ultimate "Odin's Breath," using the holy shield "Niflheim" on his right arm to manipulate the nearby weather and trigger a blizzard to continuously resist that chaos.

I didn't want to waste his good intentions, so I hurried toward the town ahead. I firmly believed that as long as we reached a populated area, it would be our home field, and we would transform from our previous identity as prey into hunters. Of course, it's possible I was overthinking it.

Judging from the subsequent results, my team members were still very reliable.

After the [Vanguard Position] was defeated, Plutomon pursued me toward the town's outskirts. The Norwegian representative, Olegmon, the [Defense Position] among us, intervened to block him. In terms of reliability, the four of us combined weren't as good as him alone; it's fair to say that with him, our [Five Nordic Countries Raiders] are destined not to fail. Unfortunately, the pity was that this time he was fighting alone against an almost invincible guy who excelled in both long-range and close-range combat and had that black chaos shield that could immune all attribute damage. No matter how high Olegmon's weight class or how much monstrous strength he used, he couldn't achieve a breakthrough, and the final result could only end in a one-sided defeat.

Entering the town, I kept shouting and calling for anyone to help me. However, the people here were either Rookies who had just completed guild registration or Champions who had been out for a while and came here for recovery; relying on them was impossible. They were also very sensible; seeing us coming, they one by one cleared the path very efficiently, and didn't even say a word of complaint, probably already scared witless.

Passing through a marketplace, I was tripped by a pole in the middle of the road. Turning back, Plutomon's right index finger was pointing exactly at my brow, less than half a fist's distance away. At the critical moment, two massive battle hammers flew from a side street, hitting the Plutomon who was about to act against me.

Looking through the fleeing crowd, a familiar figure appeared before me, gasping for breath and chewing a brown mass, looking as honest and cute as when I first knew him.

"Huff... huff... finally... caught... caught up—"

He's from Iceland, our new [Substitute Position] Vikingmon. In the matter of "rescuing fallen comrades," how could a chivalrous hero of "seeing injustice and drawing one's sword" be late?

Opening his mouth, he brought me a piece of news that sounded somewhat sorrowful: "Freyr had a bad stomach last night and went to the toilet without paper. He told us to wait for him a while, and he'll come to meet up with us after he's 'air-dried'."

I even smelled the scent in his words.

Hard to imagine how I originally promoted such a guy to join the [Raiders], speaking such words with his mouth full of chocolate; wouldn't he feel disgusted?

## (Part 2)

**-By Freyr-**

I am Freyr, from Copenhagen, Denmark. Currently working at St. Canute's Cathedral where Hans Christian Andersen was once baptized. I don't like fairy tales and long for a solitary life with only myself in the whole world, probably because I'm used to being bullied by the group of fellows around me.

I actually can't figure out why I'm usually targeted by them. Simply because I have a good temper? Perhaps that's indeed the case; who wouldn't want to pick a person with a good temper to bully? As long as it's not particularly excessive, at most I'll say a few words to them in person; if it is particularly excessive, it's actually fine—at most I'll curse a few more swear words. I suddenly realized, do I usually give them too much of a good face, to the point where they think I won't get angry? Maybe; if I want to get a conclusion on this sort of thing, I have to find a special chance to test. And I'm a person who's afraid of trouble; if I were a bit more diligent, I wouldn't be holding a Copenhagen University diploma and doing the work of a cathedral gatekeeper.

That Sunday, as usual, I was patrolling near the cathedral, picking up trash and watching tourists show affection. Bored, I pulled out my phone to check messages. Captain Agnes contacted us, telling us to go online as soon as possible to perform a new mission.

The remaining three indicated in turn "received" or "on the way." Not following their formation would make me stick out, which wouldn't be quite right. However, my EDEN haptic experience device was still at my home in Fasanvej, Copenhagen, quite a distance from my place of work. How far? Let me put it this way: from a geographical standpoint, they aren't even on the same island. Driving back would take me at least two and a half hours.

The job can't be left undone; it determines whether I starve to death in reality. The mission can't be skipped either; my absence might lead to mission failure and team members being killed in action. I can't bear the responsibility associated with lives, so I decisively chose the latter.

I wanted to retract the message I just sent out, but unfortunately they had already seen it. Distance made it certain I would be late; I had to make up a suitable reason for myself in advance. So, I privately contacted the newcomer [Substitute] who had just joined the team, telling him I had a party with friends last night, had a bad stomach, woke up to find it was already noon today, and was currently at the toilet, even forgot to bring paper, and asked them to wait for me for a bit.

"When can you arrive? Give me a definitive answer!" The newcomer had a rather fiery temper.

"Uh, anyway, no paper. How long it takes to 'air-dry', I don't know either; estimate it yourself."

I hope he can deliver the words completely.

Driving at high speed on the road, while waiting for a red light, I took my phone. The Atrium system's information page automatically pushed a message to me, the title unusually eye-catching: "Windrunner Brigade VS Fang of the Beast King." Clicking in for details, it even included a live broadcast screen. After watching for a few seconds, I thought it was quite interesting. Just as I was about to put down my phone and prepare to start, the golden bird "Freya," always following Agnes, sent us a distress message in the form of data, telling us to come quickly as its master was about to give out.

"Sorry, I'm still on the road. If I don't go, the drivers behind will rush up to beat me."

After replying with such a message, I put down my phone, stepped on the gas, and hurried through the fatal intersection just as the signal light turned yellow; the path ahead was clear.

Driving into Zealand and passing through Slagelse, my mother called me, asking if I could visit her tonight and have dinner with her. I said I was very busy; even though I was currently less than two kilometers from the nursing home where she lived, I still couldn't slow down because in another world, there was someone waiting for me to save.

"...Be proud of him. Your son is on his way to be a hero." As I spoke, one hand subconsciously pulled an ID medal from my pocket. I never dreamed it would appears here; no wonder I couldn't find it after searching the whole house for the past few days.

"Wait, Mom!" I suddenly remembered something. "Does your nursing home have EDEN haptic equipment?" "Of course, otherwise how do you think a mother in a wheelchair would experience life every day?"

With those words of hers, I was relieved; just don't find another father for me.

Making a temporary detour, I rushed into the nursing home, inserted the ID medal, logged into the Atrium system, and hoped my appearance wouldn't be too late.

**User ID: NO.05000**
**Holder: Erich Freyr Hansen**
**Gender: Male**
**Age: 43**
**User Persona: Freyr**
**Digimon: Imperialdramon: Dragon Mode**
**Guild: Imperial Dragon's Nest**

**Confirm Login: YES**

"Go, son, and knock them flat!"

"Actually, I'm going to save someone... Okay, no problem. Love you, Mom."

Touching the button on the left, I logged in successfully, then immediately switched to my Digimon form and rushed toward the coordinates given by Freya. Passing through three guild domains on the way, I finally reached the territory of [Nether Club], just in time to catch my old acquaintance Heath being in charge of evacuation work here.

I stepped forward to talk, asking what happened. He told me it was all the handiwork of the other four.

I sensed trouble. Before he finished speaking, I took the lead and interrupted him, then flapped my huge wings on both sides and rushed forward. After flying a short while, from a distance I saw a fellow draped in a blood-red cape, jet-black all over, preparing to strike a Vikingmon. Behind him lay our team's [Defense Position] and [Support Position], both dying, looking like they had just gone through a fierce battle. From this, I deduced that the Vikingmon must be our newcomer; last time I saw him, he was still a Zudomon.

**"——Positron Laser!"**

Until I offered him a greeting gift, did I see clearly that our enemy was Plutomon. His image had a slight discrepancy from what I remembered; specifically, the piece of black chaos behind him looked a bit unmatched and out of place with his overall look, a bit discordant.

Facing my sudden attack, Plutomon unhurriedly pulled over his cape to defend. The energy cannon ports on my back continued to output; no matter how powerful that cape of his was, it wouldn't be able to withstand it. Soon, after I surged forward and used the blade slash "Splendor Blade" of my forelimbs, he vanished into the ruins below.

Next, it was time to face my teammates.

"Sorry, I'm late." I originally wanted to say this to them.
"If you didn't come, we'd be dead for sure!" I originally thought they would answer like that.

Unexpectedly, none of us followed common sense.

"How come the [Main Attacker Position] isn't here? You all are acting like bears, collectively playing dead?"
"Freyr!"

They called out my name very affectionately. In that moment, I felt like a hero, admired and envied by them. And then, they asked that stupid-to-the-core question in unison: "Are you... air-dried?"

I didn't quite want to answer them; telling the truth would indeed ruin the atmosphere.

I suddenly remembered a sentence said by Guild Master Adam, who was once my lifesaver: "Before confirming the enemy is completely finished, don't relax your guard." Clearly, I made this mistake and was a step late; the enemy's brutal, evil claws had already approached me, within reach, not allowing me to make any reaction. Fortunately, the newcomer in front of me timely threw out the two heavy battle hammers on his back, thus saving my small life.

"Thanks, newcomer..."
"Watch out—"

He once again blocked in front of me, catching Plutomon's chaos strike with the thick shield on his shoulder. At this point, I could no longer stand being saved by a newcomer; this kind of embarrassing thing was enough twice, no need for a third time.

"Get out of the way, newcomer!"

I pushed him aside, intending to let that abominable enemy taste the flavor of "Mega Death." Unexpectedly, the opponent was a step ahead. After taking a hit of "Chaos Light" squarely, my whole body went limp on the ground, and I could no longer move; the surrounding environment was gradually swallowed by the piece of black chaos behind him. Now I am the one who needs to be saved.

Let me ask, whose [Main Attacker Position] is so pathetic right upon debut? Only the Nordic Five.

"Any last words, big guy?"

He completely enraged me; he's finished!

"Yes, of course I do." I told him, "They're hidden in my mouth."

As things stood, I wouldn't hide any cards anymore; use them if needed, never stingy. Whether I could breakthrough this black chaos entirely depended on what I had just held in my mouth. Before I switched to my Digimon form, I had taken a treasure from my personal inventory and swallowed it—it was a rare item named "Promotion Seed." Its role, to put it broadly, could turn the current critical situation around; to put it specifically, it could help me save everyone's lives.

"Come on!"

I let out a roar and swallowed it, and my body underwent a very noticeable change.

**Imperialdramon: Dragon Mode, Mode Change —— Imperialdramon: Fighter Mode.**

Switching modes, my body became flexible, and not by just a little bit. Meeting the enemy in this state, even with a ten-minute time limit, the enemy would surely feel pressure and shock.

Facts were just as I thought. After I finished the mode change and confronted the enemy again, a weakened trend in his momentum was clearly perceptible. The spotlight was all mine; I wonder how he feels now, presumably already prepared to pay the price. In that case, I didn't need to be polite with him either—old way, blast him to death.

With round after round of "Giga Death," he gradually became a bit unable to hold on, and could only use that piece of black chaos behind him to block in front for protection. Taking this chance, the remaining three suddenly surged—no, strictly speaking, it was four. The Finnish fellow of the [Vanguard Position] had just arrived. Four people, covered in wounds, let the Plutomon before them experience a gift from the Nordic countries; I guess, aside from a blizzard, there wasn't anything else worth presenting.

The target wasn't Plutomon, but the piece of black chaos that served him in resisting damage. It was like a stray flame, always guarding its master. Unfortunately, in the triple icy blizzard, it couldn't hold out for long and was soon firmly frozen, suffering Olegmon's "Viking Flail" and turning into data powder, dissipating among the clouds.

Losing the protection of the black chaos, Plutomon was in total disarray and tried to escape, but was surrounded by the five of us. You can imagine what happened next. "Aurvandil's Arrow," "Fenrir Sword," "Dual Battle-Axe Rotation," "Mjolnir Hammer"—every skill we could use was used on him. Finally, under the impact of a "Giga Death" released after I gathered energy, Plutomon's mission thoroughly met its conclusion.

The streets were torn up, and the town was in ruins. Looking at the large crater left on the ground, everyone let out a sigh—except for our captain, Miss Agnes. She alone was looking around for Plutomon's remains, for unknown reasons.

I subconsciously advised her: "Don't look. With such a large impact range, there's surely not even a speck left..."

She tentatively believed my words. After confirming that the cleanup work for the scene had begun, she led us back to report.

Five people, dragging their weary bodies, crawled into "A Cup of Bar" and waited for a long time before the client, Jade, finally appeared. Her face didn't look particularly beautiful, probably having encountered unpleasant things on the way.

"You're finally here, our competitors."

She rarely didn't greet me, didn't say a word, sat down at our table, hesitated repeatedly, and told us a piece of news she had just heard from someone else.

In summary, after taking a "Giga Death" from me, Plutomon unexpectedly survived. He pathetically ran to the base of [Nether Club] to beg Guild Master Jack to save him and repair his missing data. Not clear what they communicated; possibly Guild Master Jack was dissatisfied with his actions, or possibly afraid his arrival would involve himself. So, he switched to the form of Voltobautamon and solved him neatly with a "Palace Waltz."

"...Treat it as evil meeting its reward."

Is the fact really so? Perhaps we will never know.

**-By Sakura-**

"That makes sense." Owl said, snapping his fingers. "A Gabumon subspecies—except for the horn on the top of its head, there's no part of its body that needs metal to fill. Let's make a hypothesis: if he were just an ordinary newcomer with a decent reputation in the guild, even if the horn on his head broke one day, he wouldn't be in such a hurry to find us and request that we take him to 'Hephaestus Workshop' to find Master Nagasumi. Ask anyone in the guild and they'd know where the place is..."

"Reasonable."

Miss Jade sat up straight and took over Owl's words. Holding the glass in her hand, she expanded her deduction: "If, I'm saying if, that newcomer named Solomon—what if he's Plutomon's man?"

"Then it returns to the starting point," Captain Agnes answered her bluntly. "Nothing has changed."

"So, only if he works for the person who truly benefits can everything make sense."

Xiao Yong didn't quite understand and asked Jade sitting next to him: "How can you tell?"

"Think about it," Miss Jade put forward a new line of thinking for us. "What kind of role is he responsible for playing in this matter? A runner, someone who could enable 'Free Birds' to intervene in the bird-beast struggle and participate in it, and a character who is hostile to the mediation organization. In other words, although he is only a pawn in the hands of the beneficiary, the position he occupies is quite important. With him, this thing can succeed."

For a moment, everyone fell into contemplation, and the atmosphere was inexplicably quiet. Master Adam passed by us with two empty wine glasses. Seeing us all in such a serious state of thinking, he couldn't help but join in, and as soon as he spoke, he shocked us deeply.

"Having heard you say so much, if you ask me, this matter was clearly done by Jack of [Nether Club]."

I hurriedly stopped him and asked: "No, boss, why can you be so certain?"

"That's easy. I've heard him mention it before." He couldn't help but sigh. "You guys just came to the Atrium a few days late and missed all the guild conflicts and personal grudges between Guild Masters. That guy used to be at odds with Wind. Actually, strictly speaking, during that time, except for me, basically none of the other nine Guild Masters could look at each other favorably. They often quarreled over trifles, big and small... Don't mind my harsh words, none of those nine is a simple character, and none is a good person."

Hearing this, a look of embarrassment appeared on Xiao Yong's face: "You're... truly transparent."

"Ultra is the same, paranoid to a certain extent." Master Adam subconsciously supported his forehead, and his expression truly didn't look beautiful: "At the very beginning, he was the first to start having discord with Wind. I remember, in the most serious instance, the two of them directly fought as humans. I didn't expect that a big man like him would actually take a woman seriously. No matter how much I pulled, they wouldn't separate. More importantly, those punches landing on the other's face were truly something; he didn't hold back a speck of strength. The most excessive part is that this kind of conflict erupted not once or twice. One time, it even made its way to my place..."

"Then you..."

"I cleaned them both up and threw them out. If they dared to come to my place again, I'd clean them up every time I saw them."

Xiao Yong raised an eyebrow and casually muttered: "No wonder the Guild Master sent me to act for him—turned out he was afraid of getting beaten."

With the boss's words, we could basically lock onto another suspect of this incident, Jack. About him, we only knew he was "mysterious," and didn't know anything else; not only us, but the regulars in the bar were the same.

"Take my advice," Master Adam rarely showed a serious manner. "Don't go looking for him, and don't mention him in public for no reason. His eyes and ears are all over the Atrium. Once you offend him, you're destined not to be able to handle it, unless you're seeking death."

As the sister of the Master, Miss Jade raised a question on our behalf: "He... is very powerful?"

"More than powerful; more importantly, he's dangerous, no matter in which world." After saying this meaningfully, Master Adam snapped his fingers, signaling the bartender to bring another glass of wine for our table.

"Brother, why didn't I hear you mention him before?"

"At that time, you were all very weak and hadn't grown up. Naturally, you wouldn't provoke dangerous people or come into contact with dangerous things, especially things concerning human lives."

Speaking of this, Master Adam coughed twice and took the initiative to change the subject: "Voltobautamon Jack—with your current strength, you're not yet enough to be his opponent. You should know, Plutomon being instantly killed by him didn't depend all on luck; it depended more on his own terrifying strength."

Master Adam suggested that if we still wanted to know the truth behind the matter, we could try to find X (埃克斯), the top talent of [Nether Club]. He was like another version of himself in [Nether Club], knowing everything.

Agnes had concerns about this: "I've heard people say that guy doesn't have a particularly good temper, and more importantly, his face looks rather scary. Going to find him and probe him might not be that easy."

"Don't be afraid." Master Adam offered another trick for us. "His weakness, in the eyes of us Guild Masters, is practically common knowledge. Recalling back then, Master Muca used to discipline every junior who spoke rudely to him upon first meeting—he always stopped when he had the upper hand. Only X was an exception; he was beaten so miserably that a deep psychological shadow was left on him, which he hasn't been able to forget for many years. So, if during your contact with him, you feel his attitude toward you isn't particularly friendly, you can try using the name 'Old Man Muca' to intimidate him."

"But, Brother, didn't Master Muca pass away long ago?"

"Yeah, but that guy still feels 'Old Man Muca' is living in his heart, ready to lash him at any moment."

After everyone's discussion, we finally reached a consensus: the subsequent part of this matter would continue to be deeply investigated by Captain Agnes, who volunteered, and the [Five Nordic Countries Raiders] she led. Miss Jade originally wanted to join too, but first, she was stopped by her brother Master Adam, and second, she was busy handling the affairs of the [UN Five Permanent Members Raiders]. According to her, among the five of them, she's the only one free now.

"What about the other four?"

"Dragon and Zero have gone who-knows-where, Lana has to accompany their Poseidon, and Ment is busy rushing a report, leaving only your poor sister to do the work of five alone, being bossed around by the head."

Owl chimed in appropriately: "If you feel like you can't handle it alone, you can slightly depend on us."

"You?" Miss Jade showed a bit of disdain toward Owl. "Stop joking. In 'Free Birds', the only ones truly 'free' now are you two. I don't want to be the third wheel. If you have the time, help my brother clear up those people who owe debts every day, and take more care of him for me."

"We're not nannies."

"Just treat it as my request." Jade said, glanced at her brother sitting beside her, and bumped him gently: "The bar will be closed for a week starting next week. Someone's going to have surgery. The doctor and bed have already been arranged for him. Go there and directly state my name. In a while, after I finish the affairs at the [Raiders] side, I'll bring a flower basket to visit him."

The sibling affection between them was truly enviable.

After parting, Owl went to visit the remaining three injured members of "Free Birds." I stayed at the bar, helping the boss clear the empty glasses on the table and handling the aftermath.

## (Part 4)

**-By Sakura-**

"By the way, Master, I had to use the 'Promotion Seed' you gave me earlier. I know this thing is very valuable and rare, so just treat it as if I owe you. In the future, if there's an opportunity, I'll definitely..."

"No need to pay it back."

"Eh?" I'm sure I didn't hear it wrong.

"That one, strictly speaking, isn't mine." Master Adam said: "Back then, just after the 'Promotion Seed' was designed, Master Muca unexpectedly obtained one. He believed the strong don't need this stuff, so he left it with me, saying that in the future, if I also became a strong person like him and didn't need this thing anymore, I should give it away, to someone who truly needs it."

It was treated like some kind of token, passed down to me through the hands of the two masters.

"Master, about the 'Master Muca' you talk about—I've asked Owl many times before, and he never told me. Can you tell me the story about him?"

"Certainly. I see you've almost finished clearing up. Shall we drink and chat?"
"Sure."
"Please."

The final resolution of the Atrium's greatest crisis had come, not through purely superior force, but through a complex web of loyalty, sacrifice, and the enduring legacy of a long-gone master. As the five Nordic countries retreated to their domains and the mediation organization struggled to rebuild its shattered hierarchy, the "Free Birds" stood as a beacon of independence.

Bandai Sakura watched the sunset from the balcony of "A Cup of Bar," a bittersweet smile on her face. The "Promotion Seed" had changed her, but the words of Master Adam had changed her more.

The curtain falls on Phase 5, but for the Raiders of the Digital World, the next adventure is already taking shape in the heart of the Atrium.
