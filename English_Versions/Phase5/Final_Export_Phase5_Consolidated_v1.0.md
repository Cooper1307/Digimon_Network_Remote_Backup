## 1. Side Story III: Deep Danger Situation

### Part 1: The Raiders' Origins

#### — Zero's Account (Part 1) —

I do not know who I am, nor where I came from. I only know one name: Zero.

The United States federal government bestowed this title upon me. They raised me from a small child to be a network spy, tasked with handling various incidents that threatened national network security. I never disappointed them—not once. Every mission was completed flawlessly, leaving them with nothing to criticize.

Perhaps as a reward, or perhaps to discard me and make way for the younger generation, after I completed my stage-based education, they arranged for me to live in an apartment near the Pentagon and let me work with the Department of Defense.

From that day on, I followed my new superior—Zachary Lopez, a man with a distinct aura of mystery. After resigning from the CIA, he was transferred to the Department of Defense to continue his old trade. It was he who received high-level orders and arranged for an elite network spy like me to represent the United States in the [Raiders] (攻略组). At the same time, it was also he who forbade me from befriending anyone within the group, telling me to always be wary and keep my distance. He even had the nation's cutting-edge technology used to modify Jesmon, allowing me to use my swords to cut through space and create distortions at any time, entering a private space known as the "Zero Domain" (零域) to report to him.

"The Chinese representative's pet (Xiao Wang)—you are watching over (monitoring) it, correct?"

"Correct, sir."

During this past period, to prevent me from privately contacting her pet and harming or disadvantaging her, Dragon had specially created a security measure—moving her pet to a new residence, a natural volcanic lake. The place was remote and unvisited, indeed suitable for concealment. However, her pet didn't like it much there, feeling the water was too hot and uncomfortable, and the terrain was high. Every time she couldn't see Dragon going out on missions with us, her overwhelming longing drove her to sneak back to her original residence behind Dragon's back.

"If I remember correctly, that lake is a dead-water pool without a single fish left. Recently, her master has been busy [Raiding] in the depths. Don't tell me... you've been feeding her?"

In response to his speculation, I simply smiled slightly. "I have no such obligation, sir."

Later, I also explained to him that there had never been fish in the lake. She was always hungry, and at most, she could only dive to the lakebed to scavenge a few small shrimp to fill the gaps in her teeth. I wouldn't feel sorry for her or lend a helping hand, because I am not a person with a "humanitarian" spirit. Originally, I wanted to let her starve to death so I wouldn't have to act. No act means no trace, no trace means Dragon wouldn't find out, and if he didn't find out, he wouldn't suspect me. Of course, he might take his anger out on me because only I knew he kept such a large pet, but that didn't matter—at worst, I'd fight him to the death. If he lost a beloved one and gained a major grievance, I could learn more about one of his weaknesses. This would be advantageous for me and very advantageous for the United States of America. Aside from anything else, at the level of network strategy, we would have a greater advantage over the nation across the ocean. Isn't what we've been doing all for this?

"You have a great sense of awareness, Zero. You know, I'm starting to think more and more highly of you."

"Thank you for your praise, sir. This is only my duty."

"Continue."

The result was quite unexpected; that fellow was remarkably lucky. For some unknown reason, the "Demon Lord of Lust," Lilithmon, appeared on the lake surface without any warning. She was waiting at the bottom of the lake, saw movement on the surface, thought it was food, and without thinking, opened her maw and lunged up, snatching it. Without even having time to chew, she swallowed it whole. It was fortunate she was a Vaccine-type; had she been a Data-type, those data bits would surely have been infected the moment they went down.

"So, she ate a Demon Lord and obtained a portion of her data..."

Actually, it wasn't just a portion; strictly speaking, it was all of it.

I didn't tell him this directly—not because I was afraid of him getting angry, but because I feared he wouldn't be able to handle it and would reach a level of rage that would cause him to drop dead in the network world, leaving not even a corpse behind.

To keep him alive, I could only try to steer the conversation elsewhere, telling him about the situation of the "Leviamon Subjugation War" [Raid]. First was Yu of the [Vanguard Position]; BanchoStingmon couldn't utilize a vanguard's full potential in the water at all and was badly beaten by the "Demon Lord of Envy," losing half his wings. If not for Lana of the [Support Position] coming to his rescue, he might not have made it back alive. Then there was Mante of the [Defense Position]; the mechanical GrandLocomon had difficulty functioning in the deep sea and could only stay in place and take hits, thus finding it hard to escape the fate of being scrapped. Fortunately, his armor was thick enough that the Digicore wasn't damaged, so he didn't perish under Leviamon's massive jaws.

"Stop with the useless talk," Zachary said, his patience always thin. "Tell me about your performance as the [Main Attacker Position], or let's talk about our old friend, that [Substitute Position] who steals the show every time..."

In summary, the [Substitute Position] was still formidable, and the [Main Attacker Position] was still reliable. The former could react in time when the [Vanguard], [Support], and [Defense] were all offline, stepping forward to control the situation—grabbing Leviamon's jaw, curbing its struggles again and again, dragging it out of the water, and sending it into the sky. The latter could make clear judgments, ensuring the former had enough ability to send the target into a position advantageous for his finishing move, emerging from the sea surface ahead of time to make full preparations—first applying all-around suppression with the "Sword Spirits" (剑灵), then dealing the finishing blow with "Aus Generieren" (辙剑审判).

"So, for once in the United Nations Security Council [Raiders], the one in the spotlight wasn't that [Substitute Position], but you, the [Main Attacker]?"

Though it sounded harsh, it was the truth.

"Quite rare, isn't it?"

"Yes, indeed quite rare."

As he spoke, he calmed down, paused for two or three seconds, and then told me: "To tell you the truth, calling you to this "Zero Domain" wasn't just for you to report on your work. It was mainly to see if you could come over, if you were alive, and if you could log out and return to the real world, come to my office, and see the Minister with me. He has business with you."

Evidently, I happened to be free.

"When?" I asked.

"Anytime," he stated. "If I were you, I'd come after lunch, lest you go onto the battlefield with an empty stomach and the enemy (the Minister) hears your belly growl. Then, your face wouldn't be the only one losing credibility; my face would too."

*I can handle it.*

That was what I really wanted to say. Unfortunately, before I opened my mouth, I remembered a warning from my master: *You are a warrior, not a clown. Think before you speak, and know what should and shouldn't be said—especially in front of your commanding officer.*

Indeed, I have a master too.

I am also human, with my own passions and what one would call feelings. My time isn't entirely occupied by the [Raiders] and the United States of America; I also have private time for learning and enlightenment.

My master is Gankoomon, a fate that was sealed from the moment I initially chose the body of Huckmon.

He came to find me first. At our first meeting, like an old father who had been away for many years, he stood with a stern face and congratulated me on choosing his clumsy disciple's body. I told him then that I wasn't his disciple, but merely a pawn of the US federal government doing their bidding, needing to borrow his disciple's body for a while, and hoped he would be broad-minded and give me this chance. He said it didn't matter; he only recognized the body of Huckmon anyway. As for who was controlling it inside, he didn't care, didn't want to care, and was even less willing to care. His attitude toward this was quite "Obstinate" (顽固), making it impossible to refuse.

His training was extremely strict, reaching a level of harshness—otherwise, it wouldn't have been possible for me to evolve from a Rookie so quickly and rise all the way to a Mega. For example, he was always followed by a pair of Sistermon sisters, both wearing nun's caps—Sistermon Noir and Sistermon Blanc. They looked like two cute mascots, but both were fierce. They would use me as a target for practice. I could block, dodge, or counter-attack, but everything had to be "stop-at-contact"; I couldn't let my sword tip touch them even an inch, because if it did, they would surely die.

With Gankoomon watching, those two sisters were safe. There were several times when it seemed my sword would strike them and I couldn't pull back. Master Gankoomon would appear beneath my sword in an instant, blocking the fatal blow for them, and then he would surely settle the score with me. In the unluckiest cases, I would take a hit from his "Iron Fist Punishment" (铁拳制裁). He called this "Defense Training" for me, intended to hone my resilience. It left me in a pathetic state every time, but fortunately, I persevered tenaciously and didn't get beaten to death.

Occasionally, he would go out with me to complete free-exploration missions sent by higher-ups. We treated these as combat trials and developed a very strong rapport—a master-disciple duo, invincible.

He rarely acknowledged the strong, because in his eyes, there were probably only a few in the entire Digital World who could be called "Strong." Some were human, some were Digimon. Those who earned his recognition naturally became people I couldn't easily provoke. According to the order he gave... there were actually only three: DoruGoramon, HerculesKabuterimon, and LordKnightmon. I could have guessed the first and third—they were Dragon, the Chinese [Raiders] representative, and Owl (He), the leader of the [Holy Knight Regiment] (神圣骑士团). Both were indeed very strong, without question. But that the second would be a bar owner was truly unexpected.

According to Master, the owner, Adam, was the one person who shouldn't be underestimated. His strength was extraordinarily great; he could effortlessly catch the "Iron Fist Punishment" thrown by Master. In contrast, even for me, I had never caught that move even once, getting sent flying by the same technique every time. This made me feel a loss of face and even a bit discouraged.

"Don't lose heart!" he rarely encouraged me. "He is an outlier. A standard species of HerculesKabuterimon would be completely incapable of doing what he does—at least not catching my iron fist so casually..."

Every time I met Adam, it was at the bar, so I never had the chance to see his Digimon form with my own eyes. To go deeper, I knew nothing about him. According to Master's account, Adam's HerculesKabuterimon was twice the size of the natural species found in the Digital World, and his strength left them far behind. He had once been fortunate enough to witness Adam's supernatural strength: at that time, to rescue the stranded Imperialdramon, Adam took on three berserk, giant GranKuwagamon single-handedly. Even with all three attacking together, they were no match for the strength of one person on his side, and the tide was quickly turned.

"The result?"

"One was stomped to death, one had its body crushed, and the other was blasted by his 'Giga Blaster' until not a trace remained. I was watching from the side, and the impact was extraordinarily strong—the scene was quite a shock."

"If it were you in the same battle..."

"It wouldn't have been easy either." He didn't spare himself at all. "Those three lethal things were also outliers, their internal data seemed to have been modified. Defeating them would have definitely taken me ten or twenty seconds longer than him."

Ending a battle with the duration measured in seconds—this is the world of the strong.

### Part 2: Betrayal in the Pentagon

#### — Zero's Account (Part 2) —

After lunch, I hurried into the Pentagon to see my superior in his office. I didn't want him to wait, nor did I want the Minister, whom I was meeting for the first time, to wait and have a bad impression.

"Good afternoon, Mr. Zero," the guard boy greeted me proactively. "Long time no see. It's rare to see you here."

"Isn't it," I followed up. "I almost thought I'd been fired."

The truth was, we met once or twice every day and were already like brothers.

I walked quickly through the corridors, turning into one office after another and passing many unfamiliar faces until I finally arrived at my superior's office door. Inside, three voices were laughing and talking, the atmosphere seemingly harmonious. After straightening my clothes, I raised my hand just as I was about to knock, and the door suddenly opened from the inside. What caught my eye was a girl—or rather, a woman whose clothes were just on the youthful side. Looking at her face, she was probably not many years off from me.

"Oh, look who's here."

The Secretary of Defense sat up from the sofa, warmly welcoming my arrival. At the same time, my superior introduced the lady who had just proactively opened the door for me: "This is Miss Judith, your new partner."

"Partner?"

I was very surprised. Zachary knew perfectly well that I always worked alone, so why would he arrange a partner for me? What puzzled me even more was that he hadn't discussed it with me beforehand, which was very unlike his usual style.

While I was thinking, Judith had already extended her hand to greet me: "Hello, Mr. Zero. I am Judith—you can call me Judy. Or, you can just call me LordKnightmon."

I was privately seething and didn't take her hand, nor did I give her a friendly expression, behaving very unamiably. Turning my head, I muttered: "Whatever."

This cold reaction was seen by Judy. She didn't take it personally but said "I'm glad to meet you too" to defuse the awkward scene. Then, with great etiquette, she invited me into the room and thoughtfully poured me a cup of coffee, which tasted as bitter as my current mood. Compared to her open-mindedness and cheerfulness, I was like a petty jerk. An internal self-contempt continued to operate in my heart, and holding it in was quite miserable; I couldn't wait for this meeting to end.

The reality was as I wished—the meeting lasted less than six minutes in total. During that time, the Secretary of Defense didn't waste a single word with us; every sentence was tied to the mission. He and Zachary coordinated to explain the situation to us, and the summary was very simple: my master was dead, and we needed to recover his data.

After learning this, I didn't feel much grief. At most, it was the kind of feeling one has upon graduating and parting ways—not quite sadness, but a certain emptiness in the heart.

The federal government didn't know I had such a master, or rather, in their eyes, I had nothing to do with this species called Gankoomon. I didn't want to bring feelings from my private life into my work, lest they cloud my judgment. So I had always adhered to the good personal rule of "If they don't ask, I don't tell," keeping this matter buried deep in my heart.

"Where did he die?"

"An old server," the Secretary of Defense said first. The detailed address was left to Zachary: "You log in from the Atrium, follow the Network Sea, head straight ahead, pass through a Data Forest and a Data Desert, reach the edge of the desert, find a Scumon, and tell it you are going to the 'Ruins' (废墟). It will guide you there. After entering, head directly to the lower space, 'Coulomb.' Find a way to locate his residual data and bring it back."

This mission sounded easy.

Before leaving the office, Zachary called me and warned: "Don't be careless, Zero. Don't die."

"Don't worry, I won't," I replied as usual. Then, I shifted my gaze to Judy beside me, pointed at her, and facing Zachary, asked: "What about her?"

My behavior provoked Miss Judy's dissatisfaction: "Thank you for your concern, Mr. Zero. Take care of yourself before worrying about others. Honestly, what era is this, to still look down on women..."

She grumbled, pushed my shoulder aside, passed me, and left first. In response, Zachary just shrugged helplessly and said no more.

"Good luck to us."

Closing the office door, I followed Judy's footsteps.

I knew she wanted revenge, so she deliberately kept her distance from me. Later, she even took it upon herself to treat me as her stalker—from an obstacle course walk inside the Pentagon to a light jog, it finally evolved into a street sprint. I didn't catch up with her in one breath but let her run until she was exhausted, leaning against a roadside railing and gasping for air, sparks flying before her eyes, as if suffocating. Only then did I walk up slowly to watch her embarrassment.

"You caught me... are you... satisfied now?"

I didn't respond but stepped forward, pinched her face, leaned in, and told her a settled truth: "No era looks down on women; what's looked down upon is always one's own seeking of death and self-righteousness."

"Aren't you... the same?"

"Stop with the backtalk."

I increased the pressure in my hand and then threw her aside, warning her that in reality, I could let her play out her little temper, but if it came to the Digital World, she had better consider whether she might become a pile of data fragments in the next second, sleeping forever in the world of data without even having a complete soul left behind.

She knelt on the ground, adjusted her chin, and then scrambled up pathetically. "Treating a lady so roughly—you are truly a gentleman, sir."

"Thank you for the praise. Don't mention it."

Our duo was destined not to be peaceful.

The login point was established in a bar in Clarendon named "A Bar." Find the bartender, show our IDs, and he will lead you to the innermost storage room. Inside are two partitioned cabinets, each installed with EDEN haptic equipment. The login environment was absolutely safe.

"Can I trust you?" I asked the bartender.

"Rest assured, sir," his response was sincere. "A secret base designated by the Department of Defense will have no problems."

*I hope so.*

Logging into the Atrium, passing through the firewall, and switching to Digimon form—everything proceeded quite smoothly before meeting the Scumon. Smoothly to an excessive degree, actually; we didn't see a single Digimon on the way. To be honest, this was no longer a matter of being smooth, but of being abnormal.

I asked Judy if she understood the situation. She sighed. "Evidently the same as you."

The two of us cautiously explored the desert. During this time, I thought of many things—mostly unrealistic speculations and hypotheses, with no small amount of self-doubt mixed in.

Meeting the Scumon, it was very unamiable toward our arrival, its mouth full of complaints like "You're late," "This isn't what we agreed on," and "Why did only two come?" None of it made sense to me. Looking at Judy, however, she handled it with ease, answering each of the Scumon's complaints.

"I'm warning you, take us there quickly, or we'll go back and report your lack of cooperation to the Department of Defense. You know their methods—you'll be going to see your friends."

Under her threat, we successfully reached a cave, connected to that old server, logged into the EDEN system, and entered the previously mentioned lower space, Coulomb. This place was a data tomb, and even more, a labyrinth occupied by data blocks of all sizes. No natural gravity or weight could be felt, as if in space—the whole person felt light as a feather, able to move in any direction without fear of falling from a height.

"Let's begin. It's a large place; I suggest we split up."

"Since when did you start making the calls?" I said to Judy like a bad boss.

"I thought I was a person—am I not?"

Her words left me speechless, making me quite embarrassed. Although I was reluctant, the mission came first, so I could only concede: "Fine, we split up. Search carefully, don't miss anything, and keep in touch at all times."

"Thank you for your concern," she started her snide remarks again. "Call me if something happens; I'll come save you. Don't lose your life for the sake of pride—it's not worth it."

She was truly self-righteous.

Wandering alone in the data labyrinth, no living thing could escape my keen eyes. When I say living things, I don't mean living things in the true sense, but a group of Ebemon (机械脑魔). It was just one or two at first. I used my five Digimental Inscription Swords to execute them quickly. Later, the deeper I went, the more I discovered. When hundreds of Ebemon swarmed toward me, I realized I had fallen into their ambush.

The hunter had become the hunted, and the scene suddenly became lively. Weaving through beams of light and rays, I turned on my communication device to call Judy, but under the influence of those fellows, I couldn't establish contact with her. If she were in the same situation as me, she might already be in dire straits.

"Poor thing."

After feeling sorry for her for two seconds, I began to handle these mechanical modified products in earnest.

Zachary had once mentioned in front of me the Digimon experiments conducted in Area 51, saying the US federal government had captured a group of Vademon from the Digital World for research. Later, the entire facility's system was infected by an unknown virus. They couldn't stop the virus from spreading and didn't want it invading the mainstream network, so they had to cut their losses and seal them away. Who would have thought those viruses would invade the then-popular EDEN electronic space in a way humans couldn't imagine, causing the entire Coulomb region to fall. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say humans brought it on themselves.

These Ebemon were quite dangerous—at least, so the data said. Their left hands would release "Brain Rupture" (脑裂), launching a cracking program from the left muzzle toward the opponent's brain to suck out brain data and perform internal analysis, formulating collective combat strategies or even predicting the opponent's next move. Their right hands, "Planet Destroyer" (行星毁灭者), would release massive energy—supposedly enough to destroy a planet instantly, though I doubted if that was true.

I estimated that Master Gankoomon had been besieged by them, outnumbered and unfamiliar with their combat style, leading to his failure and demise. Now it was my turn; I couldn't make the same mistake he did. I had to annihilate them in one go before they gathered more companions.

"Master, watch carefully!"

With the power of the three "Sword Spirits," I collectively formed a large green triangular prism in front of me. Then, I injected my own power into it, and the four of us combined to release a powerful green shockwave from within—"All For One" (我为人人).

Those Ebemon weren't to be trifled with either. Although they hadn't analyzed my internal data, they had gained experience from previous battles and knew I could easily slash them, so none dared get too close. This resulted in the shockwave's energy accumulation being interrupted by the enemy's joint efforts. To prevent this, I specially pulled up the red cape behind me; it could help me resist for a while, allowing me to unleash "All For One" and clear out this rabble.

But I didn't expect an outsider to intervene and interrupt my charging. That outsider was none other than LordKnightmon Judy, who had come here with me. She actually stood on the side of the Ebemon, silently appearing behind me and joining them and the seemingly endless army of Knightmon under her command to launch a dead-end siege against me. The combination of long-range and close-range combat was very comprehensive. I could handle ten or twenty, but if hundreds or thousands came, I would truly find it hard to cope. Experiencing dual pressure from both physical and psychological levels simultaneously, I was momentarily unable to attend to everything. At this rate, I would sooner or later be forced into a corner.

"I'm sorry, Master!"

If you can't win, retreat—this was the last move he taught me. Although the process would be a bit pathetic, it could to a large extent avoid a portion of the danger, thereby preserving a life.

Preserve your life, and you can make a comeback. Master hadn't remembered this most basic of principles before his death. Perhaps it was his unyielding and obstinate character that led to his defeat, or perhaps his repertoire simply didn't include this so-called last move of "Retreating is the best path," only "Giving one's life in a desperate struggle."

In a daze, I seemed to hear again that sentence he often said to me: *Kid, don't die! Remember, if you die, no one will cry for you, no one will feel sad, and even less will anyone seek revenge for you.*

Yet, he was actually right.

### Part 3: Evolution of Jesmon GX

#### — Zero's Account (Part 3) —

The server entrance was set on the edge of the desert, where no one visited and no one would disturb—no matter how much noise was made, no one would notice. It was a perfect place for handling someone in the way. Unfortunately, that someone was me. After thirteen years of faithful service, risking my life for the nation and solving countless network security incidents, I was ultimately betrayed by my own superiors.

They wanted me dead because I was too elite.

If I didn't die, the spies ranked behind me wouldn't move up. If they didn't move up, the manpower would always be sufficient, and future new spy training plans would repeatedly fall through. The nation wouldn't allocate new funds, and they would have no way to exploit loopholes for embezzlement. Since it involved their interests and I was a social "invisible person" with no family and no friends, I naturally became that lamb to be slaughtered. It wasn't convenient to act in reality for fear of leaving evidence, so they used the mission as a pretext to lure me into the Digital Space and bring me to this place for a secret execution.

My master's death was merely a catalyst, or rather, an accident.

Using a data loophole in the network, he had previously discovered a problem with the Department of Defense's financial report for the last quarter. He conducted a private investigation and saw through their despicable trick of using me as a cover, intending to meet them to demand an explanation for his dear disciple—me. He didn't expect to be stood up by those scumbags and instead be met with the guns and cannons of a group of Ebemon.

The reason I knew this was because the culprit stood before me and confessed proactively. I hadn't expected them to come in person, probably fearing that their lapdog Judy wouldn't lead me to the right place.

"Look who's here."

That familiar voice came from the body of Craniummon. If he was the Secretary of Defense, then the Duftmon beside him must be Zachary.

These two rarely visited the Digital World, so I assumed they wouldn't be too troublesome. In a one-on-one duel, I had full confidence I could beat them. But the current situation was different—I had just escaped from a group of Ebemon's guns and cannons, heavily wounded and hit by multiple "Planet Destroyers," fortunately saved by my cape taking the hits. It had now honorably sacrificed itself, turning to ash and leaving me. Simultaneously, I had taken multiple "Brain Ruptures," causing certain problems with my mental state; the visual feed could cut out at any time, and I was at risk of being pincered by them from front and back and killed.

Fortunately, there was a firewall between the Digital World and the external server, which prevented the external virus from invading the network's interior—in other words, it blocked the Ebemon army. LordKnightmon Judy and her Knightmon were completely unaffected, as they originated from this side. They caught up with me from behind. Seeing me blocked by the two leaders and failing to escape, the heart that had been in their throats finally eased.

The Secretary of Defense said with a dark face: "You're late, Judy."

"My apologies, sir," her apology was sincere. "He was too fast, I... I did my best."

"Don't let it happen again." Zachary changed back from "Leopard Mode" to human form, speaking before the Secretary of Defense could, pardoning his subordinate's lapse while also preempting his superior's complaint to avoid turning on their own and letting me slip away.

I had to admit, Zachary was always shrewd and considered problems comprehensively; he was a natural "Strategist." It wouldn't be easy to escape from under his nose, even if the current me wasn't the me of before—dealing with the three of them plus a group of Knightmon would be a hard battle.

While fleeing in Coulomb, I unexpectedly obtained my master's Digicore. It was like a spirit wandering in space, looking for its master—me. It proactively approached the wounded me, entered my body, and merged with me. Subsequently, my body underwent a very noticeable change: the red and white across my entire body were swapped, and the three-in-one "Sword Spirits" merged with Master's "Hinokamuy" (火神威), forming a brand-new spiritual armament attached to my back.

**Jesmon, Evolve! —— Jesmon GX!**

Master's voice echoed in my ears, and I suddenly felt filled with power. Using this momentum, I immediately retaliated against these people who dared think they could take my life.

I utilized my main weapon, the "Endless Gauntlet" (无尽手套), switching it into forms like sword, fist, and shield to target the three of them. The Secretary of Defense, Craniummon, was old and experienced, immediately unleashing "God Breath" (神之庇佑), using the magic shield "Avalon" to make my attacks ineffective for a short period. Seizing this chance, Zachary and Judy attacked from front and back, unleashing "Aussterben" (毁天灭地) and "Urgent Fear" (急迫恐惧) respectively. The intense beams of light and the close-range shockwaves left me with only a choice between two sides for protection; no matter which I blocked, the other would hit. In that case, I might as well abandon defense and put all my energy into the subsequent counter-attack.

"Lend me your strength, Master!"

Focusing my gaze on my direct superior, Zachary, I drove the brand-new tactical armament, concentrating energy at a single point to unleash the ultimate technique inherited from Master—"Seiken Metsuha" (圣拳灭破). A series of sub-light-speed strikes, swift and graceful, allowed Zachary in the form of Duftmon to feel the full weight of his subordinate's resentment, leaving him no room to escape and personally burying him in this data desert to be carried away by the wind and sand.

"Father—!"

Judy suddenly cried out behind me, and only then did I realize I had just done something foolish.

Her full name was Judith Lopez. Currently, she stood woodenly in place, unmoving and wordless, fallen into deep collapse, unable to accept the truth for the moment.

Looking at her, my sword hesitated. If killing a beast was for self-preservation, then killing the beast's daughter would surely be worse than a beast.

After only three seconds, Secretary Craniummon seized the opportunity. He lunged behind me, spinning his magic spear at high speed and unleashing his prized technique, "End Waltz" (终结华尔兹). I intended to pull away quickly to dodge the massive shockwave, but a turn found me facing Judy; though I couldn't read the expression on LordKnightmon's face, I could still sense her pain and resentment through her trembling breath.

"Give me your life, you executioner!"

She coordinated with Secretary Craniummon, releasing four ribbon blades from her armor and unleashing "Spiral Masquerade" (回旋华舞) for my reception.

The situation was the same as before; I didn't dodge, instead taking these two sustained damage sources head-on, showing my most resilient side to explain to Judy: "I didn't want to do this. Your father... Zachary forced me."

She couldn't hear my words, still using the "Pile Bunker" (冲击锥) on her right wrist to hammer my hard body over and over. For the current me, it was like scratching an itch, unable to cause any damage. Even if she sent more Knightmon to help, they would be cleared with a single slash. She knew this, yet maintained her persistence, swearing to avenge her father—it was clear how deep the feelings were between father and daughter.

To get rid of her, I had to be rough with her one more time. I swung my sword, sending her back into the embrace of the Knightmon army, then quickly turned, catching the Secretary's magic spear with my left hand and pointing the blade in my right hand toward him.

"I am not an executioner!" I stared fiercely at the culprit before me and told Judy: "He is!"

At this point in the performance, a clown would usually take off the mask and admit the truth—the same for the Secretary of Defense. He flipped the magic spear, turning the other end to thrust at me. I held my sword horizontally in my right hand, blocking his attack and entering a stalemate with him.

"I don't deny it," the Secretary of Defense said in person. "But you must also admit it."

I was furious, immediately roaring at him: "Admit what? That I am an executioner? Wasn't that thanks to you? Haven't I done enough dirty work for you before!"

Since he had already admitted it personally, I didn't need to waste any more words with him. Adhering to the philosophy that "betrayers must die," I flicked aside his magic spear with my sword, turned back, and delivered another slash, letting him personally experience the feeling of the body being split in two.

"You shouldn't have treated me like this."

Unfortunately, he left too quickly to hear these last words of mine.

After dealing with the two people who betrayed me, the only things standing in my way were a group of Knightmon and Judy, who led them.

"It's not over yet, Zero!"

Judy threw harsh words at me. I didn't respond because, from my point of view, this game was already over.

Without a doubt, the winner was me.

The outcome was decided, the player had left the stage, and a pawn shouldn't become a sacrifice in a game—whether for her or for me. Moreover, they were no match for me; even with a massive numerical advantage, they couldn't bridge the inherent gap in power. Continuing to fight had no meaning; her persistence was to avenge her father, while I had lost all reason for battle. So, I chose to let her go, sparing her life and showing a rare moment of gentleness. This was the first and last time.

"I don't hate you, Judith Lopez."

Leaving those words, I entered that desert again without looking back.

Draggin my scarred body and following the traces left by Scumon when it slipped away, I headed forward through the wind and sand. During this time, I thought about many things. This ordeal was exhausting and wounding, both physically and mentally. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say I had lost everything.

The hollow in my chest throbbed with continuous pain, from which my internal data kept gushing out. A portion had been infected by the virus carried by the Ebemon. Fortunately, when this body and underwent modification, it was equipped with a data reconstruction program; as long as there were supplementary data, it could function, transforming them into internal data compatible with my body, filling my wounds and discharging the infected virus, allowing me to regain vitality. My master's Digicore was the best supplementary data. If it hadn't been for it to sustain my life, I wouldn't have lasted this long.

Looking at the current situation, returning to reality was impossible. Judy clearly hadn't forgiven me; she would blame me for the Secretary's and her father's deaths, and the federal government would give her an answer. By then, I would not only have to bear the crime of being a murderer but also be called a traitor by the uninformed, suffering humiliation from all sectors of society. I'd never have a good day in this life.

Continuing to wander in the Digital World, I still had nowhere to go. The "Zero Domain" was forcibly blocked, and there were eyes planted by the federal government within the major guilds. I believed they would soon issue a warrant for me. When that happened, not only them but also a considerable number of greedy people would stand on the opposite side of justice, executing that so-called justice for another nation and another government.

Danger was everywhere, and everywhere would become my final resting place, leaving me no choice.

Thinking of this, my damaged body finally reached its limit. It pathetically collapsed in this desert, failing to make any expected response no matter how I tried to control it.

Gradually, my thoughts were blown away by the wind and sand, my will was submerged, and I lost my proper consciousness, experiencing the feeling of the soul ascending to heaven. In that moment, dreaming back to the beginning, it was as if Gankoomon was by my side, swearing and cursing with a heart full of passion, teaching me roughly as he always did. It felt very intimate and very nostalgic.

For a moment, I even felt that I had truly become Jesmon, truly had such a strict master, truly laid down the burden on my shoulders, said goodbye to the US federal government, and transformed from a tool into a living person.

### Part 4: Rescuing the Sisters

#### — Zero's Account (Part 4) —

When I woke up, I found myself in a tea garden, my body back in human form, lying on a rattan chair.

The owner of the tea garden sat beside me. He was an old acquaintance, the one I used to constantly target. With him there, my safety was guaranteed; I needn't worry about the federal government putting a bounty on my head in the Atrium, because no fool was willing to become his enemy—except for the former me, who didn't know the height of the heavens.

Seeing me wake up, he put on a sour face, casually picked up the teapot on the table, and poured me a cup of bitter tea that could scald me to death. With arms folded across his chest, mouth twisted, and eyebrows furrowed, looking as if I owed him thirty thousand US dollars, he wore a face that was quite unwelcoming as he greeted me: "You're actually still damn well alive."

"Sorry to disappoint you."

His appearance surprised me greatly, but also made me feel a touch of joy and tension.

"How long was I unconscious?" I asked.

"How should I know," he stated.

That was the harmonious way we got along.

"Explain why you were sleeping in the desert."

"Explain why you rescued me."

Our way of getting along was also very friendly.

"I don't pick up trash. It was Mante."

Subsequently, he explained the situation to me one by one. To summarize simply: he and Mante had gone together to execute a [Raid] mission, defeated the domain ruler Daemon (究极魔兽), liberated a new Digital region, and returned in triumph. While passing through the desert, they found I was blocking their way.

"Stop being so sentimental," he interrupted. "We have eyes—we'd actively avoid trash."

The last battle with Leviamon had severely damaged Mante's GrandLocomon; after repairs proved fruitless, he had to announce its retirement and would no longer provide carrying services.

"I heard from the Russian guy at 'Mousse Mine' that the higher-ups are building a brand-new version of the database for him. It's a massive project and will take a long time. So, he has temporarily changed his form to HiAndromon. Where he got it, I'm not clear—you can go ask the leader of the [Steel Legions] (钢铁雄兵) guild if he's willing to tell you."

"Where is he?"

"Who, Mante? He was in a hurry to get back and submit the performance test report, no time to care about you."

So, he handed me, this broken piece of trash, to Dragon, which was why I appeared here.

Afterward, Dragon told me: "I've swapped positions with him."

"Why?" I was very puzzled.

"Asking the obvious—what kind of defense could a HiAndromon provide? Until his next version is developed, I'll be [Defense] and he'll be [Substitute]. Your rear will be guarded by me."

That last sentence made me break into a cold sweat; I could only say it was the result of a conditioned reflex.

"There is no US representative anymore."

"What?"

"The era of the five is over, Dragon." I couldn't help but sigh and confessed to him: "From now on, the UNSC [Raiders] only has four. Good luck, continue to explore, continue to be loyal to your countries, and perform your duties as tools. You are burdened with unlimited expectations—don't disappoint the people above, don't disappoint the people of your nations, and don't... disappoint me."

He snapped his fingers in front of me, interrupting. "Do you know what you're saying?"

"Of course," I stated. "I haven't reached the age of confusion yet."

I told him about my ordeal truthfully. Unlike my previous attitude, this time I was full of sincerity; after all, he was no longer my enemy, and there was no need to be constantly against him as before.

I focused on the matter of his pet sneaking back to her original residence, advising him to find her as soon as possible and arrange a new home to prevent the federal government from causing her trouble. In exchange, I hoped he could provide me with a relatively safe environment to continue surviving. If possible, I hoped to negotiate with the Chinese government through him to seek political asylum so I could return to reality and completely become a person again.

"Forget it. The Chinese government doesn't accept a dog that has bitten its master, even if that dog has no teeth." He rejected me righteously, then shifted the topic: "Do you like soaking in hot springs? I'll let you soak to your heart's content."

I didn't expect him to be even harder to break than me—hearing him say "thank you" was like reaching the heavens. However, he did express his gratitude with actions: he very generously gave me the volcanic lake previously used to house his pet, allowing me to hide there to convalesce and restore my body to its original state as quickly as possible.

"The Five... the Five are indispensable."

According to him, as long as I was still an American, the [Raiders] would still recognize my identity. With the backing of multiple other nations, there was no fear of threats from the US government.

"What if the [Raiders] face retaliation?"

"I will step in."

As he spoke, a trace of confidence naturally crossed his face, deeply shocking my heart. "It's been a long time since I've found a worthy opponent. Let them come—the more, the better. My skills aren't meant for hoarding."

Behind his peerless arrogance lay immense energy. Formidable and terrifying power, much like the DoruGoramon symbolizing terror and trepidation—having endured thousands of battles and always remaining undefeated. Every battle was an absolute affirmation of his own strength. Such a person, such a Digimon, had no reason to retreat, no reason to fear retaliation from others, and no reason not to protect the weak—for he *was* the strong.

We were once rivals and enemies. Now it seemed I was the one clinging to a higher branch. This time, he didn't just help me; he saved my life, preserved my face, kept my dignity, and didn't make me crawl on the ground begging like a truly fallen master. This was his greatest mercy to me.

I didn't know how to thank him, so I could only make a promise: in the future, I would never again monitor him or his pet. I would be duty-bound to help in any way needed.

"I don't need that last one... but the first one, you can keep appropriately."

His meaning was to have me take care of his pet for him. It just so happened that it wasn't convenient for me to show my face outside for the time being, and I couldn't participate in the [Raiders] side either—to be frank, I hadn't yet emerged from the shadow of being betrayed by my nation. And the so-called "taking care of" was nothing more than feeding fish and keeping watch to prevent others from plotting against his pet. Think about it carefully, and it wasn't a bad job.

"You don't plan to change her residence?"

"It's a 'she'—she is a person." He spoke in a solemn voice. "A young girl has her own pursuits; we grown men shouldn't be overbearing. If she wants to stay in the old place, let her. Going deep is too dangerous, and I'm not at ease either."

I advised him: "What's there to fear? She swallowed a Lilithmon before."

Without thinking, and without even hearing clearly, he stated: "Eating that kind of dirty stuff is unhealthy... What did you say? She ate what?!"

I truthfully repeated it: "The 'Demon Lord of Lust,' Lilithmon. Don't worry—she's a Vaccine-type, so she's not afraid of being infected. But it's best to be careful; if she develops a lustful heart for you, I can't help."

"Nonsense. And it's not like you *could* anyway."

With that, he stroked his chin and looked me up and down. Then he leaned in and asked: "What about you? If she has eyes for you and develops a lustful heart..."

"I'll be at your disposal."

"That won't be necessary."

I hadn't expected him to respond like that.

"What did you just say? Say it again."

He raised an eyebrow and stated: "Let nature take its course. Accept a relationship ten years younger."

*Relationship?* I didn't think one day I would harvest such a thing, which was completely unrelated to me. The role of the old father was played very well, but unfortunately, I didn't want to be his son-in-law.

"Fine. I'll just pretend I didn't hear that."

"As you wish," he didn't continue to make things difficult for me. "Just pretend I didn't say anything either."

At the moment, one problem remained before me: after Gankoomon's death, where did the Sistermon sisters go?

In the previous confrontation, I didn't remember the Secretary of Defense or Zachary mentioning them. Could that prove they hadn't met? Gankoomon, as usual, had placed them in a safe area, prioritizing their safety before going to meet his fate alone. If so, then they must still be alive.

"Dragon, have you seen a pair of Sistermon sisters?"

"If you mean the two new laborers at 'Mousse Mine,' then I have indeed seen them."

*Third time's the charm.* I didn't want to hear that name from him again.

Mousse Mine was originally an independent server used to reform network prisoners, which humans found very difficult to enter without external connections. The Digimon inside were just like me—all modified, and each one was fierce, terrifying, and a genuine monster.

My master Gankoomon had once had the fortune to go there, back then to save a friend of his. Those in charge of the guard work were a group of Deathmon (死亡兽). They gave Master a lot of trouble—clashing with them, Master gained no advantage. "Iron Fist Punishment" was easily neutralized, "Quaking Table" was pinned back to the ground, and finally, after using all his strength, he unleashed the move "Gijin! Shinkou! Shinkaku! Oyaji!" (地神！神鸣！神驰！亲父！) to bring down "Hinokamuy" for heavenly retribution.

Afterward, Master, dragging his weary body, successfully rescued his friend. Unfortunately, on the way back, they were discovered by three giant GranKuwagamon on patrol and had their path blocked. Fortunately, it wasn't just them who were blocked; Adam, who had also come to rescue his fellow citizens and was also stopped by them, was there too. To protect the Imperialdramon behind him, Adam finally defeated them three-to-one. At the same time, Master realized that even among humans, there existed strong ones who could rival him.

I suddenly asked Dragon: "Who is the 'Russian guy at Mousse Mine' you mentioned?"

"Just a Russian guy, a proxy for the [Steel Legions] (钢铁雄兵) guild—not anyone major. Why? Do you have business with him? Don't tell me you want to go rescue those 'Sistermon sisters' you just mentioned."

"They are my family."

With a sense of shame, I successfully uttered these words I had previously kept buried in my heart. Immediately, they were met with his rebuttal: "Nonsense. When did those two Chinese girls become your family?"

I was very surprised and retorted: "They are human?"

"Nonsense! Are you the only one in the world allowed to be!"

"That's not what I meant..."

I explained the situation to him. After hearing it, he nodded slightly in recognition. "Treating them like family... I suppose that's understandable. However, I can responsibly tell you that they are indeed human, not Digimon."

"How can you tell?"

Dragon told me that the sisters had once suffered severe brain damage in a car accident and had become persistent vegetative states. Their father was a well-known Chinese Digimon scholar who didn't want his daughters to leave him, so according to their brainwave frequencies, he wrote a new set of Digital algorithms to allow his daughters to be reborn in the Digital World. One could tentatively understand them as people who had no 'User Identification Medal' but wouldn't be recognized as BUGs by the Atrium system.

I asked him again: "How do you know all this?"

"It so happens," he admitted proactively, "the director of that hospital is actually my distant cousin—the one you all know as the leader of the [Imperial Dragon's Nest] (御龙巢穴) guild..."

*ShineGreymon: Burst Mode (BM).*

I hadn't expected such a relationship existed between them.

"Can you come help me?"

"What, afraid the Russian guy will play tricks on you and seek revenge? Don't be silly. He doesn't have the time..."

"Just say if you'll help or not."

One sentence, straight and to the point. Not just for me, but for him as well.

He picked up the teacup on the table, brought it to his mouth, took a small sip, and unhurriedly spoke that sentence full of helplessness yet extremely powerful—"Only the weak are left in the mine." In other words, the strong inside had long since been taken care of by him.

He had helped me a huge favor again. I would remember his kindness, and him as a person.

"Hey, where are you going?"

"To save them."

He gave a wry smile. "What's the hurry? Finish this cup of tea before you go."

"The tea is too hot. I'll drink it when I get back."

## 2. Chapter 9: Into the Water World (第九章 深入水世界)

Ferrying a "hacker" to the Deep Sea Temple inside Atlantis was the mission Owl accepted.

Strictly speaking, the person we were escorting wasn't exactly a hacker, but more of a person with the appearance of a hacker. According to himself, he had once been a mid-level researcher at Bandai Namco, later fired for "failing to properly manage internal data," and coincidentally logged into the network world just before the system was fully updated, transforming into a Pufferfishmon (刺豚兽).

"I am a law-abiding citizen," he kept emphasizing as we navigated the Network Sea. "That 'hacker' label was just a slander from my competitors. They couldn't stand my genius, so they framed me."

Owl didn't care about his personal history, only about the safety of the mission. The "Free Birds" were currently sailing a borrowed junk ship, which felt out of place in the high-tech environment of Atlantis hub.

"Atlantis isn't a place for people like me," Pufferfishmon whispered, looking at the shimmering domes of the underwater city in the distance. "The 'Deep Sea Temple' is different; it's a private domain, a neutral ground where even the Guild Master of Atlantis, Poseidon, has limited reach."

Crane, who was navigating through the turbulent currents, added: "Don't be so sure. The Network Sea is unpredictable. We're currently in a zone where the 'Amphibious Brothers' are known to patrol. Those MetalSeadramon are not to be trifled with."

Sakura (Rosemon) looked at the vast blue expanse below. "Is it true? That the guardian of this sea is Poseidon's wife?"

"Lana, the AncientMermaimon," Owl confirmed. "She is known for her aggressive temperament. She won't let us pass without a proper explanation, especially if we're carrying someone labeled as a 'threat'."

As if on cue, the water around the ship began to boil. A massive whirlpool formed directly in our path, and from its depths, a shimmering figure emerged—AncientMermaimon Lana.

"Halt!" her voice echoed through the water, vibrating in our very bones. "Who dares attempt to smuggle a criminal into the sacred grounds of the temple?"

Pufferfishmon turned pale. "Oh no... it's her. She remembers me."

"Explain yourself, traveler," Lana demanded, pointing her trident at the ship. "Or be prepared to be swallowed by the abyss."

Owl stepped forward. "We are the Free Birds. We carry a client. His crimes are not our concern; his safety is our contract."

"Then your contract ends here!"

The battle began with a literal splash.

---

<a name="chapter-10-raging-tides-and-furious-roars"></a>

## 3. Chapter 10: Raging Tides and Furious Roars (第十章 狂涛怒啸)

The whirlpool's pull was immense. Owl was the first to be knocked overboard, his BlackWarGreymon armor proving heavy in the turbulent water.

"Owl!" Sakura cried out, but she had her own problems. Two MetalSeadramon had emerged from the depths, their metallic bodies glistening like deadly torpedoes.

"Leave the fish to us!" Crane shouted, his Craneform shifting through the water with unexpected agility. He and Sakura coordinated their attacks. Sakura used her "Forbidden Temptation" (禁断诱惑) to slow down the first MetalSeadramon, while Crane delivered a series of precise strikes with his leg blades.

The battle underneath the surface was chaotic. Pufferfishmon was huddled in a corner of the ship, which was now miraculously staying afloat thanks to some invisible force.

"You're not bad for land-dwellers," a booming voice echoed. Neptunemon (Poseidon) had appeared, standing atop the head of the third MetalSeadramon. "But you've brought a plague to my doorstep. This hacker once spread rumors about the royal family—rumors that nearly destabilized the diplomatic relations of the Atrium."

"I was just telling the truth!" Pufferfishmon screamed.

Poseidon ignored him and aimed his trident "Trishula" at Sakura. "You protect a liar. That makes you complicit."

Just as the situation reached a breaking point, a flurry of pink petals descended from the water's surface, somehow remaining dry and vibrant in the deep sea.

"That's enough, Poseidon."

Guild Master Flower (BanchoLilimon) appeared, floating gracefully in a bubble of air. "Senior Muca wouldn't be pleased if he heard you were bullying juniors over some petty rumors."

The name "Senior Muca" seemed to have a magical effect. Poseidon's eyes narrowed, but he eventually lowered his trident. "Lilimon. You always interfere at the most inconvenient times."

"It's called mediation, darling," she smirked. "The mission is complete. Pufferfishmon has reached the temple's borders. Let him go to his 'lost love'."

Poseidon sighed. "Very well. But if he ever leaves the temple, he belongs to the sharks."

The "lost love" mentioned turned out to be a Marin Angemon, who had been waiting at the temple's gates. Their reunion was surprisingly touching, reminding Sakura that even in this digital world, data could carry genuine affection.

As we prepared to leave, Sakura asked Adam later at the bar: "Why did Poseidon listen to Guild Master Flower? Who is this Muca?"

Adam polished a glass. "Muca is a legend, Sakura. He's the one who taught many of the current Guild Masters. His word is law, even if he's no longer around to enforce it."

<a name="chapter-11-claws-and-fangs"></a>

## 4. Chapter 11: Claws and Fangs (第十一章 利爪与尖牙)

The peace didn't last long. A new mission arrived, and this time, it involved a search for a missing person: Master Nagasumi (Vulcanusmon), the legendary blacksmith.

"Without him, the Atrium's weapon supply will dwindle," Owl explained. "But more importantly, he's one of the ten Mediators. If he's gone, the balance of power shifts."

The narrative then shifted to the history of the Olympos XII. Originally an unreliable group of individualists, they had been forged into a cohesive mediation organization by Jupitermon. However, internal dissension was growing.

A conflict had erupted between the "Fang of the Beast King" (led by BanchoLeomon, known as Ultra) and the "Windrunner Brigade" (led by Orphanimon, known as Wind). It was a struggle between beasts and birds, mirroring a long-forgotten rivalry.

"Wind is being too soft on the 'Substitutes'," Ultra roared during a public confrontation in the Atrium square. "The Raiders should be the ones leading, not some glorified security guards."

Owl decided to intervene. He didn't like being caught in guild politics, but the stability of the Atrium was at stake. He gathered the Free Birds and a few elite members from both guilds—including a newcomer named Xiao Yong in the form of Rasenmon.

"We go to Sanhara," Owl declared. "The Mediators are meeting there. If we find Master Nagasumi, we find the answers."

The journey to Sanhara was tense. Falcon and Dove were unusually quiet, sensing the weight of the coming confrontation. Sakura felt a premonition of danger—a shadow that didn't belong to any of the known guilds.

---

<a name="chapter-12-battle-of-sanhara"></a>

## 5. Chapter 12: Battle of Sanhara (第十二章 圣原之战)

The battle at Sanhara plateu was the most intense conflict the Free Birds had faced.

Minervamon's "Olympia" sword was a blur of steel. Sakura (Rosemon) found herself pushed to the limit. "You talk a lot for someone who claims to be a god!" Sakura shouted, using her "Forbidden Temptation" to create an opening.

"I am the goddess of war, little rose," Minervamon countered, her voice full of amusement. "War is my language."

Around them, the other Olympos XII members were engaged in their own duels. Falcon was matching speed with Merukimon, while Dove used her "Lullaby" to keep Bacchusmon at bay. Crane, however, was struggling against the shifting illusions of Junomon.

The turning point came when Minervamon, frustrated by Sakura's resilience, unleashed her "Promotion Seed" (晋升之种). In a blinding flash of light, she evolved into Mervamon.

"Now... let's see how you handle this," Mervamon smirked, her presence becoming even more overwhelming.

Owl intervened, his VictoryGreymon form clashing with Mervamon's blade. "Sakura, get back! This is out of your league!"

But Sakura didn't retreat. She felt a new power surging within her. "I'm tired of being told what's in my league, Owl."

She used a Giglio missile to temporarily blind Mervamon, allowing the Free Birds to regroup. However, the battle was far from over. The Mediators were just testing their strength.

---

<a name="chapter-13-final-judgment"></a>

## 6. Chapter 13: Final Judgment (第十三章 最终审判)

As the battle at Sanhara reached a stalemate, the true mastermind was finally revealed.

It wasn't Minervamon, and it wasn't the Beast King. It was Wind (Orphanimon), who had orchestrated the entire "Bird-Beast Conflict" from the shadows. She had used Ultra (BanchoLeomon) to create a staged hostility, then lured the Free Birds and the Mediators into a mutually destructive war.

"Why, Wind?" Sakura asked, her voice trembling with disbelief. "Why would you betray the Atrium?"

"The Atrium is stagnant," Wind's voice echoed, though it sounded distorted. "It needs a purge—a new order."

However, the "Wind" standing before them was just a puppet. The real Wind had been killed in reality by Jack's subordinate. The voice belonged to the narrator of Gaiden 3—Plutomon.

Plutomon had used Wind's identity to log into the network. He had systematically defeated Ceresmon, Dianamon, Apollomon, and even the Nordic members who tried to intervene. His goal was the total destruction of the Olympos XII.

"I am the judge of the underworld," Plutomon declared, his black Chaos power erupting like a volcano. "And my sentence is death."

He forced Junomon to evolve into Junomon: Hysteric Mode, using her as a weapon against her own master, Mastemon. The scene was one of total chaos and despair. Even Jupitermon, the leader of the Olympos XII, was brought to his knees by the sheer weight of Plutomon's resentment.

## 7. Side Story IV: Subjugation of Plutomon (外传四：普路托兽讨伐战)

### Part 1: The Nordic Investigation

#### -Account of Agnes (Part 1)-

My father arranged a blind date for me. I didn't want to go, afraid I wouldn't find any common topics with the guy. Just as I was looking for an excuse to decline, an excuse found its way to me.

The person who contacted me was the younger sister of my first boyfriend, Aurelie Lefebvre, who was also my senior in university. She reached out to me as the representative of the French [Raiders], trying to convince me to help her investigate a certain person. Originally, she wanted to go through the formal process and report it to the [Raiders] lead for assignment, but the leader was away, so she contacted me first.

"You've come to the right person."

I accepted without a second thought.

"The target likely isn't a friendly character, Agnes. Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?"

"By the time I finish reconsidering, the bird will have flown." I thanked her for her kind warning and told her: "Don't worry, the five Nordic countries are a group; we always act together. If there's a lead, I'll give you an answer immediately."

Hanging up, I ignored my father's persuasion outside the door, shared the news with the representatives of the other four Nordic countries, locked the door, went to the EDEN haptic equipment, wiped off the dust, inserted my ID medal, and logged into the long-lost Atrium system. Sanhara was still as beautiful as ever.

Switching to the form of Valkyrimon, I was about to fly up to find Guild Master Wind and ask about the situation. Just as I was about to move, my companion golden bird "Freya" stopped me, warning me to be alert as something dangerous was approaching.

Hiding behind a massive rock and looking around, I soon saw a Plutomon. He was muttering to himself, full of self-reproach, as if he had just done something wrong to someone.

I followed him all the way, hoping to hear some useful clues from his mouth to save the trouble of disturbing our Guild Master, who loved to pursue freedom and the wind. He seemed to have a screw loose, personally confessing every crime he had committed—including how he used Guild Master Wind's ID medal to log into the Atrium in her identity and played the "Free Birds" and the mediation organization like puppets.

My intuition judged that he was the culprit I was looking for.

So I stepped forward immediately to engage in negotiation; the reason I didn't act immediately was because I still tried to believe that what he had just said was all nonsense. After questioning him once, not only did he not answer a single question, but he turned back and asked me: "Did you hear everything I just said?"

I gave him an affirmative answer. He smiled twice at me, ended with a contemptuous tone, and then stated that I knew too much about him, so he had to silence me and not let me return alive to tell others, even gentlemanly asking me to prepare to be quickly terminated by him.

"Please, is there any point in these empty words?" I said to him disdainfully. "Straight talk: we're both Megas, who are you trying to intimidate?"

The next second, he released a piece of black chaos from behind him, vanished into it, and instantly appeared behind me. Fortunately, with Freya's timely warning, his sneak attack didn't succeed. I made a prompt decision and drew the "Fenrir Sword" hanging on my left waist to counter-attack.

The sword touched his hard body and instantly froze it. But in the blink of an eye, he was swallowed by that clump of black chaos again, then restored to his state before being frozen, reappearing before me.

"Is this all you've got?"

He subjected me to verbal humiliation. As a descendant of the "Valkyrie," how could I tolerate this? So I shot my "Aurvandil's Arrow" at him, which never missed. Little did I expect that he would casually pull over a piece of chaos from behind him, turning it into a shield and blocking it very easily.

It's no exaggeration to say that aside from my best skill in team command, my [Support Position] tricks were exhausted. It's hard to imagine that a person like me would become the captain of the [Five Nordic Countries Raiders]; sometimes, I feel ashamed for myself.

Realizing that my amateur skills weren't enough to take him down alone, I immediately changed my strategy, switching from offense to defense, leading him toward populated areas to create a relatively large commotion and cause a stir, so I could meet up with the others as quickly as possible. If all five of us were present, I doubted he would have the power to turn the tide.

I excelled at speed, so dodging was my forte—little did I know it was also his.

Following me with a relentless pursuit, I didn't gain a single advantage and ended up covered in wounds, often being blasted from the sky to the ground, rolling and crashing into trees and rocks, the scene becoming as pathetic as could be.

Holding my waist and lying on the ground, I gradually realized I might not make it to a populated area, so I intended to turn back and fight to the death, to see whose life was harder.

The results proved that his was harder.

I was beaten to a pulp, with no way to resist. The feathers on my body were continuously burned by the black chaos, and the pain from the skin burns made me scream again and again, but it only made him more excited, more wanting to strip a bird-person like me from the data combination and have my soul completely infected by this dangerous virus, becoming another scourge threatening the Atrium.

Wanting to beg for mercy, but unable to open my mouth.
Wanting to run away, but unable to move my legs.
Falling into such a state, it's no exaggeration to say my life was "in imminent danger." I didn't know if this power of his was innate or obtained through effort; regardless, I could be sure that the black chaos on him absolutely didn't belong to the Atrium—in other words, the Atrium couldn't produce a monster like him.

"Miraculous, right?" He leaned close to my ear and whispered softly: "This black thing has given me power. It cannot be destroyed by your ultimate moves, cannot be cleared as data, and cannot even be identified as a bug by the system. With it, no one is my opponent. Everyone who stands in my way will be swallowed by it, becoming its nourishment and prompting it to continuously supply me with power. And you are but an appetizer; I can tell it to be a bit gentler to you, so you don't go so painfully."

"Does it require me to pay any price?"

"Of course not," he replied quickly. "Erasing your existence is the price."

I felt more and more that even if the five of us gathered, we might not be able to handle him, because that piece of black chaos would always block all fatal damage for him, and sometimes it could even become transparent, appearing unexpectedly and giving you a hard blow from behind, becoming a weapon to plot against you.

"I want to know where you got such a treasure?"

I gritted my teeth and struggled to ask this question. My strength was gradually being sucked away, my spirit became withered, and even the vision before my eyes hadn't escaped the influence, blurring bit by bit.

"Like you, I also want to know."

He told me that back then, to pursue power beyond the mediation organization, he stepped into that barren land in the Digital World and then honorably fainted. When he woke up, he found he possessed this miraculous power.

"...And even completed a stage-skipping evolution."

"Stage-skipping? How... how is that possible?"

"Believe it or not," he said indifferently. "No executioner would lie to a dying person. It... indeed happened, right to me. I also want to figure out what's going on, but unfortunately, there aren't enough talents in the Atrium. Perhaps, at this moment, someone has hidden in their territory and figured it out."

He had ignored one thing from the beginning, and that was why I had fallen to such a state. Logically, in terms of speed, he and I were evenly matched, and it shouldn't lead to a one-sided situation, unless "Freya," the golden bird that always reminded me how to dodge attacks from behind, had been sent out temporarily to perform another task. For example, calling someone, leading the way—and all I had to do was cooperate with it, delay Plutomon, and buy more time for it until my reinforcements arrived.

Hard work pays off; just before my left arm was disabled, the first reinforcement arrived—Sleipmon, the representative from Finland and the [Vanguard Position]. The "Bifrost" was fired from the holy crossbow "Muspelheim" in his left hand, and Plutomon, unable to dodge in time, had to take this hit squarely.

Upon meeting, he sent a greeting gift to our enemy, which not only distracted him but also bought enough time to rescue me. It seems his [Vanguard Position] is quite reliable.

"Go quickly, I've got this."

After saying this, he was knocked aside by Plutomon's "Chaos Light." With the holy shield "Niflheim" on his right arm as a block, the damage he sustained was minimal.

Seeing this, Plutomon naturally wouldn't leave him much room to breathe. After dropping two chaos bombs in quick succession, our vanguard Sleipmon completely disappeared into a patch of chaos. When we saw him again, he had been forced to use his hidden ultimate "Odin's Breath," using the holy shield "Niflheim" on his right arm to manipulate the nearby weather and trigger a blizzard to continuously resist that chaos.

I didn't want to waste his good intentions, so I hurried toward the town ahead. I firmly believed that as long as we reached a populated area, it would be our home field, and we would transform from our previous identity as prey into hunters. Of course, it's possible I was overthinking it.

Judging from the subsequent results, my team members were still very reliable.

After the [Vanguard Position] was defeated, Plutomon pursued me toward the town's outskirts. The Norwegian representative, Olegmon, the [Defense Position] among us, intervened to block him. In terms of reliability, the four of us combined weren't as good as him alone; it's fair to say that with him, our [Five Nordic Countries Raiders] are destined not to fail. Unfortunately, the pity was that this time he was fighting alone against an almost invincible guy who excelled in both long-range and close-range combat and had that black chaos shield that could immune all attribute damage. No matter how high Olegmon's weight class or how much monstrous strength he used, he couldn't achieve a breakthrough, and the final result could only end in a one-sided defeat.

Entering the town, I kept shouting and calling for anyone to help me. However, the people here were either Rookies who had just completed guild registration or Champions who had been out for a while and came here for recovery; relying on them was impossible. They were also very sensible; seeing us coming, they one by one cleared the path very efficiently, and didn't even say a word of complaint, probably already scared witless.

Passing through a marketplace, I was tripped by a pole in the middle of the road. Turning back, Plutomon's right index finger was pointing exactly at my brow, less than half a fist's distance away. At the critical moment, two massive battle hammers flew from a side street, hitting the Plutomon who was about to act against me.

Looking through the fleeing crowd, a familiar figure appeared before me, gasping for breath and chewing a brown mass, looking as honest and cute as when I first knew him.

"Huff... huff... finally... caught... caught up—"

He's from Iceland, our new [Substitute Position] Vikingmon. In the matter of "rescuing fallen comrades," how could a chivalrous hero of "seeing injustice and drawing one's sword" be late?

Opening his mouth, he brought me a piece of news that sounded somewhat sorrowful: "Freyr had a bad stomach last night and went to the toilet without paper. He told us to wait for him a while, and he'll come to meet up with us after he's 'air-dried'."

I even smelled the scent in his words.

Hard to imagine how I originally promoted such a guy to join the [Raiders], speaking such words with his mouth full of chocolate; wouldn't he feel disgusted?

### Part 2: The Hero's Detour

#### -Account of Freyr (Part 2)-

I am Freyr, from Copenhagen, Denmark. Currently working at St. Canute's Cathedral where Hans Christian Andersen was once baptized. I don't like fairy tales and long for a solitary life with only myself in the whole world, probably because I'm used to being bullied by the group of fellows around me.

I actually can't figure out why I'm usually targeted by them. Simply because I have a good temper? Perhaps that's indeed the case; who wouldn't want to pick a person with a good temper to bully? As long as it's not particularly excessive, at most I'll say a few words to them in person; if it is particularly excessive, it's actually fine—at most I'll curse a few more swear words. I suddenly realized, do I usually give them too much of a good face, to the point where they think I won't get angry? Maybe; if I want to get a conclusion on this sort of thing, I have to find a special chance to test. And I'm a person who's afraid of trouble; if I were a bit more diligent, I wouldn't be holding a Copenhagen University diploma and doing the work of a cathedral gatekeeper.

That Sunday, as usual, I was patrolling near the cathedral, picking up trash and watching tourists show affection. Bored, I pulled out my phone to check messages. Captain Agnes contacted us, telling us to go online as soon as possible to perform a new mission.

The remaining three indicated in turn "received" or "on the way." Not following their formation would make me stick out, which wouldn't be quite right. However, my EDEN haptic experience device was still at my home in Fasanvej, Copenhagen, quite a distance from my place of work. How far? Let me put it this way: from a geographical standpoint, they aren't even on the same island. Driving back would take me at least two and a half hours.

The job can't be left undone; it determines whether I starve to death in reality. The mission can't be skipped either; my absence might lead to mission failure and team members being killed in action. I can't bear the responsibility associated with lives, so I decisively chose the latter.

I wanted to retract the message I just sent out, but unfortunately they had already seen it. Distance made it certain I would be late; I had to make up a suitable reason for myself in advance. So, I privately contacted the newcomer [Substitute] who had just joined the team, telling him I had a party with friends last night, had a bad stomach, woke up to find it was already noon today, and was currently at the toilet, even forgot to bring paper, and asked them to wait for me for a bit.

"When can you arrive? Give me a definitive answer!" The newcomer had a rather fiery temper.

"Uh, anyway, no paper. How long it takes to 'air-dry', I don't know either; estimate it yourself."

I hope he can deliver the words completely.

Driving at high speed on the road, while waiting for a red light, I took my phone. The Atrium system's information page automatically pushed a message to me, the title unusually eye-catching: "Windrunner Brigade VS Fang of the Beast King." Clicking in for details, it even included a live broadcast screen. After watching for a few seconds, I thought it was quite interesting. Just as I was about to put down my phone and prepare to start, the golden bird "Freya," always following Agnes, sent us a distress message in the form of data, telling us to come quickly as its master was about to give out.

"Sorry, I'm still on the road. If I don't go, the drivers behind will rush up to beat me."

After replying with such a message, I put down my phone, stepped on the gas, and hurried through the fatal intersection just as the signal light turned yellow; the path ahead was clear.

Driving into Zealand and passing through Slagelse, my mother called me, asking if I could visit her tonight and have dinner with her. I said I was very busy; even though I was currently less than two kilometers from the nursing home where she lived, I still couldn't slow down because in another world, there was someone waiting for me to save.

"...Be proud of him. Your son is on his way to be a hero." As I spoke, one hand subconsciously pulled an ID medal from my pocket. I never dreamed it would appears here; no wonder I couldn't find it after searching the whole house for the past few days.

"Wait, Mom!" I suddenly remembered something. "Does your nursing home have EDEN haptic equipment?" "Of course, otherwise how do you think a mother in a wheelchair would experience life every day?"

With those words of hers, I was relieved; just don't find another father for me.

Making a temporary detour, I rushed into the nursing home, inserted the ID medal, logged into the Atrium system, and hoped my appearance wouldn't be too late.

**User ID: NO.05000**
**Holder: Erich Freyr Hansen**
**Gender: Male**
**Age: 43**
**User Persona: Freyr**
**Digimon: Imperialdramon: Dragon Mode**
**Guild: Imperial Dragon's Nest**

**Confirm Login: YES**

"Go, son, and knock them flat!"

"Actually, I'm going to save someone... Okay, no problem. Love you, Mom."

Touching the button on the left, I logged in successfully, then immediately switched to my Digimon form and rushed toward the coordinates given by Freya. Passing through three guild domains on the way, I finally reached the territory of [Nether Club], just in time to catch my old acquaintance Heath being in charge of evacuation work here.

I stepped forward to talk, asking what happened. He told me it was all the handiwork of the other four.

I sensed trouble. Before he finished speaking, I took the lead and interrupted him, then flapped my huge wings on both sides and rushed forward. After flying a short while, from a distance I saw a fellow draped in a blood-red cape, jet-black all over, preparing to strike a Vikingmon. Behind him lay our team's [Defense Position] and [Support Position], both dying, looking like they had just gone through a fierce battle. From this, I deduced that the Vikingmon must be our newcomer; last time I saw him, he was still a Zudomon.

**"——Positron Laser!"**

Until I offered him a greeting gift, did I see clearly that our enemy was Plutomon. His image had a slight discrepancy from what I remembered; specifically, the piece of black chaos behind him looked a bit unmatched and out of place with his overall look, a bit discordant.

Facing my sudden attack, Plutomon unhurriedly pulled over his cape to defend. The energy cannon ports on my back continued to output; no matter how powerful that cape of his was, it wouldn't be able to withstand it. Soon, after I surged forward and used the blade slash "Splendor Blade" of my forelimbs, he vanished into the ruins below.

Next, it was time to face my teammates.

"Sorry, I'm late." I originally wanted to say this to them.
"If you didn't come, we'd be dead for sure!" I originally thought they would answer like that.

Unexpectedly, none of us followed common sense.

"How come the [Main Attacker Position] isn't here? You all are acting like bears, collectively playing dead?"
"Freyr!"

They called out my name very affectionately. In that moment, I felt like a hero, admired and envied by them. And then, they asked that stupid-to-the-core question in unison: "Are you... air-dried?"

I didn't quite want to answer them; telling the truth would indeed ruin the atmosphere.

I suddenly remembered a sentence said by Guild Master Adam, who was once my lifesaver: "Before confirming the enemy is completely finished, don't relax your guard." Clearly, I made this mistake and was a step late; the enemy's brutal, evil claws had already approached me, within reach, not allowing me to make any reaction. Fortunately, the newcomer in front of me timely threw out the two heavy battle hammers on his back, thus saving my small life.

"Thanks, newcomer..."
"Watch out—"

He once again blocked in front of me, catching Plutomon's chaos strike with the thick shield on his shoulder. At this point, I could no longer stand being saved by a newcomer; this kind of embarrassing thing was enough twice, no need for a third time.

"Get out of the way, newcomer!"

I pushed him aside, intending to let that abominable enemy taste the flavor of "Mega Death." Unexpectedly, the opponent was a step ahead. After taking a hit of "Chaos Light" squarely, my whole body went limp on the ground, and I could no longer move; the surrounding environment was gradually swallowed by the piece of black chaos behind him. Now I am the one who needs to be saved.

Let me ask, whose [Main Attacker Position] is so pathetic right upon debut? Only the Nordic Five.

"Any last words, big guy?"

He completely enraged me; he's finished!

"Yes, of course I do." I told him, "They're hidden in my mouth."

As things stood, I wouldn't hide any cards anymore; use them if needed, never stingy. Whether I could breakthrough this black chaos entirely depended on what I had just held in my mouth. Before I switched to my Digimon form, I had taken a treasure from my personal inventory and swallowed it—it was a rare item named "Promotion Seed." Its role, to put it broadly, could turn the current critical situation around; to put it specifically, it could help me save everyone's lives.

"Come on!"

I let out a roar and swallowed it, and my body underwent a very noticeable change.

**Imperialdramon: Dragon Mode, Mode Change —— Imperialdramon: Fighter Mode.**

Switching modes, my body became flexible, and not by just a little bit. Meeting the enemy in this state, even with a ten-minute time limit, the enemy would surely feel pressure and shock.

Facts were just as I thought. After I finished the mode change and confronted the enemy again, a weakened trend in his momentum was clearly perceptible. The spotlight was all mine; I wonder how he feels now, presumably already prepared to pay the price. In that case, I didn't need to be polite with him either—old way, blast him to death.

With round after round of "Giga Death," he gradually became a bit unable to hold on, and could only use that piece of black chaos behind him to block in front for protection. Taking this chance, the remaining three suddenly surged—no, strictly speaking, it was four. The Finnish fellow of the [Vanguard Position] had just arrived. Four people, covered in wounds, let the Plutomon before them experience a gift from the Nordic countries; I guess, aside from a blizzard, there wasn't anything else worth presenting.

The target wasn't Plutomon, but the piece of black chaos that served him in resisting damage. It was like a stray flame, always guarding its master. Unfortunately, in the triple icy blizzard, it couldn't hold out for long and was soon firmly frozen, suffering Olegmon's "Viking Flail" and turning into data powder, dissipating among the clouds.

Losing the protection of the black chaos, Plutomon was in total disarray and tried to escape, but was surrounded by the five of us. You can imagine what happened next. "Aurvandil's Arrow," "Fenrir Sword," "Dual Battle-Axe Rotation," "Mjolnir Hammer"—every skill we could use was used on him. Finally, under the impact of a "Giga Death" released after I gathered energy, Plutomon's mission thoroughly met its conclusion.

The streets were torn up, and the town was in ruins. Looking at the large crater left on the ground, everyone let out a sigh—except for our captain, Miss Agnes. She alone was looking around for Plutomon's remains, for unknown reasons.

I subconsciously advised her: "Don't look. With such a large impact range, there's surely not even a speck left..."

She tentatively believed my words. After confirming that the cleanup work for the scene had begun, she led us back to report.

Five people, dragging their weary bodies, crawled into "A Cup of Bar" and waited for a long time before the client, Jade, finally appeared. Her face didn't look particularly beautiful, probably having encountered unpleasant things on the way.

"You're finally here, our competitors."

She rarely didn't greet me, didn't say a word, sat down at our table, hesitated repeatedly, and told us a piece of news she had just heard from someone else.

In summary, after taking a "Giga Death" from me, Plutomon unexpectedly survived. He pathetically ran to the base of [Nether Club] to beg Guild Master Jack to save him and repair his missing data. Not clear what they communicated; possibly Guild Master Jack was dissatisfied with his actions, or possibly afraid his arrival would involve himself. So, he switched to the form of Voltobautamon and solved him neatly with a "Palace Waltz."

"...Treat it as evil meeting its reward."

Is the fact really so? Perhaps we will never know.

### Part 3: The Gathering at the Bar

#### — Sakura's Narrative (Part 3) —

"That makes sense." Owl said, snapping his fingers. "A Gabumon subspecies—except for the horn on the top of its head, there's no part of its body that needs metal to fill. Let's make a hypothesis: if he were just an ordinary newcomer with a decent reputation in the guild, even if the horn on his head broke one day, he wouldn't be in such a hurry to find us and request that we take him to 'Hephaestus Workshop' to find Master Nagasumi. Ask anyone in the guild and they'd know where the place is..."

"Reasonable."

Miss Jade sat up straight and took over Owl's words. Holding the glass in her hand, she expanded her deduction: "If, I'm saying if, that newcomer named Solomon—what if he's Plutomon's man?"

"Then it returns to the starting point," Captain Agnes answered her bluntly. "Nothing has changed."

"So, only if he works for the person who truly benefits can everything make sense."

Xiao Yong didn't quite understand and asked Jade sitting next to him: "How can you tell?"

"Think about it," Miss Jade put forward a new line of thinking for us. "What kind of role is he responsible for playing in this matter? A runner, someone who could enable 'Free Birds' to intervene in the bird-beast struggle and participate in it, and a character who is hostile to the mediation organization. In other words, although he is only a pawn in the hands of the beneficiary, the position he occupies is quite important. With him, this thing can succeed."

For a moment, everyone fell into contemplation, and the atmosphere was inexplicably quiet. Master Adam passed by us with two empty wine glasses. Seeing us all in such a serious state of thinking, he couldn't help but join in, and as soon as he spoke, he shocked us deeply.

"Having heard you say so much, if you ask me, this matter was clearly done by Jack of [Nether Club]."

I hurriedly stopped him and asked: "No, boss, why can you be so certain?"

"That's easy. I've heard him mention it before." He couldn't help but sigh. "You guys just came to the Atrium a few days late and missed all the guild conflicts and personal grudges between Guild Masters. That guy used to be at odds with Wind. Actually, strictly speaking, during that time, except for me, basically none of the other nine Guild Masters could look at each other favorably. They often quarreled over trifles, big and small... Don't mind my harsh words, none of those nine is a simple character, and none is a good person."

Hearing this, a look of embarrassment appeared on Xiao Yong's face: "You're... truly transparent."

"Ultra is the same, paranoid to a certain extent." Master Adam subconsciously supported his forehead, and his expression truly didn't look beautiful: "At the very beginning, he was the first to start having discord with Wind. I remember, in the most serious instance, the two of them directly fought as humans. I didn't expect that a big man like him would actually take a woman seriously. No matter how much I pulled, they wouldn't separate. More importantly, those punches landing on the other's face were truly something; he didn't hold back a speck of strength. The most excessive part is that this kind of conflict erupted not once or twice. One time, it even made its way to my place..."

"Then you..."

"I cleaned them both up and threw them out. If they dared to come to my place again, I'd clean them up every time I saw them."

Xiao Yong raised an eyebrow and casually muttered: "No wonder the Guild Master sent me to act for him—turned out he was afraid of getting beaten."

With the boss's words, we could basically lock onto another suspect of this incident, Jack. About him, we only knew he was "mysterious," and didn't know anything else; not only us, but the regulars in the bar were the same.

"Take my advice," Master Adam rarely showed a serious manner. "Don't go looking for him, and don't mention him in public for no reason. His eyes and ears are all over the Atrium. Once you offend him, you're destined not to be able to handle it, unless you're seeking death."

As the sister of the Master, Miss Jade raised a question on our behalf: "He... is very powerful?"

"More than powerful; more importantly, he's dangerous, no matter in which world." After saying this meaningfully, Master Adam snapped his fingers, signaling the bartender to bring another glass of wine for our table.

"Brother, why didn't I hear you mention him before?"

"At that time, you were all very weak and hadn't grown up. Naturally, you wouldn't provoke dangerous people or come into contact with dangerous things, especially things concerning human lives."

Speaking of this, Master Adam coughed twice and took the initiative to change the subject: "Voltobautamon Jack—with your current strength, you're not yet enough to be his opponent. You should know, Plutomon being instantly killed by him didn't depend all on luck; it depended more on his own terrifying strength."

Master Adam suggested that if we still wanted to know the truth behind the matter, we could try to find X (埃克斯), the top talent of [Nether Club]. He was like another version of himself in [Nether Club], knowing everything.

Agnes had concerns about this: "I've heard people say that guy doesn't have a particularly good temper, and more importantly, his face looks rather scary. Going to find him and probe him might not be that easy."

"Don't be afraid." Master Adam offered another trick for us. "His weakness, in the eyes of us Guild Masters, is practically common knowledge. Recalling back then, Master Muca used to discipline every junior who spoke rudely to him upon first meeting—he always stopped when he had the upper hand. Only X was an exception; he was beaten so miserably that a deep psychological shadow was left on him, which he hasn't been able to forget for many years. So, if during your contact with him, you feel his attitude toward you isn't particularly friendly, you can try using the name 'Old Man Muca' to intimidate him."

"But, Brother, didn't Master Muca pass away long ago?"

"Yeah, but that guy still feels 'Old Man Muca' is living in his heart, ready to lash him at any moment."

After everyone's discussion, we finally reached a consensus: the subsequent part of this matter would continue to be deeply investigated by Captain Agnes, who volunteered, and the [Five Nordic Countries Raiders] she led. Miss Jade originally wanted to join too, but first, she was stopped by her brother Master Adam, and second, she was busy handling the affairs of the [UN Five Permanent Members Raiders]. According to her, among the five of them, she's the only one free now.

"What about the other four?"

"Dragon and Zero have gone who-knows-where, Lana has to accompany their Poseidon, and Ment is busy rushing a report, leaving only your poor sister to do the work of five alone, being bossed around by the head."

Owl chimed in appropriately: "If you feel like you can't handle it alone, you can slightly depend on us."

"You?" Miss Jade showed a bit of disdain toward Owl. "Stop joking. In 'Free Birds', the only ones truly 'free' now are you two. I don't want to be the third wheel. If you have the time, help my brother clear up those people who owe debts every day, and take more care of him for me."

"We're not nannies."

"Just treat it as my request." Jade said, glanced at her brother sitting beside her, and bumped him gently: "The bar will be closed for a week starting next week. Someone's going to have surgery. The doctor and bed have already been arranged for him. Go there and directly state my name. In a while, after I finish the affairs at the [Raiders] side, I'll bring a flower basket to visit him."

The sibling affection between them was truly enviable.

After parting, Owl went to visit the remaining three injured members of "Free Birds." I stayed at the bar, helping the boss clear the empty glasses on the table and handling the aftermath.

### Part 4: The Master's Legacy

#### — Sakura's Narrative (Part 4) —

"By the way, Master, I had to use the 'Promotion Seed' you gave me earlier. I know this thing is very valuable and rare, so just treat it as if I owe you. In the future, if there's an opportunity, I'll definitely..."

"No need to pay it back."

"Eh?" I'm sure I didn't hear it wrong.

"That one, strictly speaking, isn't mine." Master Adam said: "Back then, just after the 'Promotion Seed' was designed, Master Muca unexpectedly obtained one. He believed the strong don't need this stuff, so he left it with me, saying that in the future, if I also became a strong person like him and didn't need this thing anymore, I should give it away, to someone who truly needs it."

It was treated like some kind of token, passed down to me through the hands of the two masters.

"Master, about the 'Master Muca' you talk about—I've asked Owl many times before, and he never told me. Can you tell me the story about him?"

"Certainly. I see you've almost finished clearing up. Shall we drink and chat?"
"Sure."
"Please."

<a name="chapter-14-dragon-and-god"></a>

## 8. Chapter 14: Dragon and God (第十四章 龙与神)

The heroic dragon warrior lowered the massive sword on his shoulder, pointing it at his old friend, and was the first to state his position: "Data Clearing Style, Owl—Reporting for duty!"

The God of Heaven followed closely: "Data Clearing Style, Vulture—Reporting for duty!"

Thereafter, the two simultaneously displayed a confident posture, gripping their greatswords at the same moment. Once the impact before them had completely dissipated, they rapidly closed in on each other. The two giant swords crossed and joined, generating a massive energy that pushed both back, forcing them to pull apart once more.

The frontal clash yielded no result, so the two immediately shifted strategy, unfolding a duel of sword techniques supported by speed. Dragging their giant swords, the two wove through the forest and fields; every swing was incredibly heavy, and the damage caused was enough to alter part of the terrain. As members who had both been taught the "Data Clearing Style" under Master Muca, the two were equally hardworking and had both received direct instruction from their master. Thus, in terms of sword skills, they were evenly matched, making it difficult to determine a victor.

Owl swung his sword, but Vulture retreated and jumped onto a nearby tree, then raised the thunderous greatsword high, firing a golden bolt of lightning straight into the sky. A vast expanse of thunderclouds answered his call, raining down fierce thunderclaps in response.

Before the lightning flashes, Owl's evasion was as slow as an old turtle in its twilight years. He didn't want to be decapitated, so he could only stand his ground, waving his giant sword and repeatedly turning away the invitations from heaven.

Seeing this, Vulture rose again, hovering in the sky and moving into Owl's blind spot. He injected a portion of his energy into the greatsword, then aimed it at Owl's body to execute a new form of "Divine Punishment." Owl, however, had long noticed his old friend's ill intentions and kept a constant eye on his movements. When the thunderous sword plunged from behind his head, Owl immediately gripped the "Dorumon Breaker," turned, and struck a "Victory Charge" at Vulture. Using the massive blade of the "Dorumon Breaker" as a shield, he absorbed the energy stored within the opponent's sword and released it again, looking as if Vulture's attack had been completely reflected.

Vulture was caught off guard by Owl's move, suffering the pain he had brought upon himself. Before he could adjust his hovering for stability, Owl's next retaliation had already arrived.

The ten-minute limit was approaching; time was running out.

Owl didn't have time to overthink; he directly unleashed his ultimate move, "Trident Gaia." Rotating the hilt, he pulled the central spine connected to it, while closing both sides of the guard, causing the left and right blades to connect from the pommel, forming a completely new, sharp blade. In a dual-wielding fashion, he concentrated all the energy existing in the atmosphere at the tips of the two blades, gradually forming a massive energy cannon.

Seeing his old friend intended to end the battle as quickly as possible, Vulture had the same idea. He transformed himself into high-voltage plasma and injected it into the thunderous greatsword. Just before Owl could drop that massive energy cannon on him, he reversed the blade early, thrusting the thunderous greatsword forcefully into the ground and releasing the most destructive "Wide-Range Divine Punishment."

The two extreme powers clashed once more, and the Atrium shook again because of it.

"Guild Master—"

"Don't worry about it!"

Adam timely called back Kuin, who was planning to go out and investigate, and simultaneously stopped the agitated behavior of the customers in the bar, telling them to stay calm: "Everyone, it's just the mediation organization performing official duties. We're just a small guild and can't afford to provoke them; be careful of curiosity killing the cat."

Saying this, he turned back and gave a look to the bartender at the counter.

"Let me say, everyone, we're all sensible people. It's better to just sit down and have a drink. The next round is on me—drink as much as you like, and don't be polite."

If one looked closely, it wasn't hard to notice that Guild Master Adam's back was already soaked in cold sweat. Even without being physically present, he could feel the magnificent scene and couldn't help but break into a cold sweat for "Free Birds."

Deep within the explosion where their combined energy converged, the two held their swords against each other. Their convictions reached a peak in that moment; no one had concerns or hesitations. Both hoped to defeat the strong one before them and move toward the next height.

"Are you prepared to lie on the ground, Owl!"

"It's still too early!"

After the simple greeting, both sides simultaneously unleashed the "Data Clearing Style" swordsmanship for the decisive victory. A cold light flashed through, and the battle between the Dragon and the God finally reached its conclusion.

The smoke dissipated, and the setting sun spilled down. A gentle breeze brushed past their ears, and at this moment, they both collapsed on the ground in unison, both having lost their fighting spirit and reverting to human form.

"Tell me, Owl, why did I lose?"

"You didn't."

"Bullshit! Losing is losing; I won't fail to admit such a thing. So, you'd better not use that hypocritical face of yours to compliment and deal with me—I don't buy that."

Hearing this, Owl had no choice but to say that heartbreaking sentence: "You didn't receive the true heritage of Master Muca."

"True heritage? I didn't know there was such a thing... what is it?"

"The final ultimate art of the 'Data Clearing Style' that can only be performed with dual-wielding—Rakukyoukijuzan (落枭归鹫斩). Listen to this strange name; doesn't it speak exactly of us?"

"Heh, I suppose it does."

With those words, Vulture showed a look of compromise, gazing up at the sky that wasn't too far from them, and let out a sigh: "We're still the same as before, unable to understand him. We truly were defeated by him."

That feeling seemed like reminiscing about the past, yet also like thanking their master.

Master Muca, you truly are the greatest blacksmith in the Atrium. Even knowing you were to part with this world, you didn't forget to forge two swords no less than "Kiku-rin"... one named "Owl" and one named "Vulture."

Thanks to you, those two swords are still as cold and sharp as ever today. Just like you back then, they are always guarding the Atrium.

"Soon, our people will be here."

"Who isn't? Everyone goes to their own home and finds their own mother. Today's business is entirely a thing of the past; treat it as if it never happened."

"How about calling them and going for a drink together?"

"You're paying."

"I'll kill you."

## 9. Chapter 15: A Beautiful End (第十五章 华丽的归宿)

The matter reached a perfect resolution.

Upon returning, we exchanged information with Kuin, Master Adam's younger sister, and the members of the [Five Nordic Countries Raiders], and generally understood the cause and effect of this "Beast-Bird Struggle."

"Although there's still a part where we haven't figured out what exactly happened, it doesn't matter."

These words were very problematic; it sounded as if those people died for nothing. How their souls could find peace—Miss Agnes likely never even thought about it.

A group of people sat in the bar, gathered around two tables, and began to speculate randomly on the motive of the mastermind, Plutomon. No need to worry about leaking news; the arrival of the mediation organization had already caused a significant loss of customers for the bar. It was lucky that Guild Master Adam was an exception among guild masters; since the establishment of "A Cup of Bar," he had always maintained neutrality with other guilds and had clearly defined his own relationships, which was why he didn't have to face the mediation organization with swords drawn.

Owl pulled me aside at this point, asking about my previous situation. I knew he was worried about me, and also clearly knew that the situation at the time, even now in hindsight, still filled me with deep fear.

At that moment, Mervamon's greatsword was about to strike my head. I had a quick idea and fell back onto the grass behind me. Just before her "Final Strike Slash" arrived, I swallowed the gift Guild Master Adam had given me—a "Promotion Seed." Subsequently, the red on my body gradually turned to white, and the cloak on my back was dyed with a touch of pink, adding a hint of girlishness to the original "Queen of Flowers and Grass," thus breaking through my own limits.

Rosemon, Burst Evolution—Rosemon: Burst Mode.

The burst evolution at the critical moment was something I'd never forget in my life.

"And then?"

"And then I discovered a completely new operational mode."

I had said before that Bandai Sakura never liked fighting or killing. Thus, the network data satisfied her wish, weakening a portion of her combat ability and thereby deepening her charm attribute. For example, giving the opponent a sudden kiss, making them confused and even a bit shy; taking advantage of her being stunned on the spot, I amplified the aura of my cloak, wrapping her gently inside and making her fall into a deep sleep.

"So, you didn't destroy her?"

"That's right."

I didn't deny it.

"Then... where is she?"

"Still in the same old place," I explained to Owl. "She's sleeping too soundly; I couldn't drag her. To be honest, I didn't expect the effect of 'Charm' to be so strong. I'll tell you secretly, don't tell anyone else—I slapped her twice, very hard, and even that didn't wake her up."

After Owl finished listening, he gave a helpless shrug and stated: "Well, as long as everyone is alive."

I didn't know which one of us he was talking about.

Through this battle, the mediation organization successively lost four major generals: Junomon, Ceresmon, Apollomon, and Dianamon. Windrunner Brigade's Guild Master Wind and Rainbow Starlight's Wing also honorably sacrificed themselves. Now the Windrunner Brigade is taken over by the survivor, Hana. Xiao Yong barely defeated Master Nagasumi, who was going easy on him, and the battle between Guild Master Ultra and Marsmon ended in a draw, which could be considered as not dragging down the "Total Victory Group."

In contrast, the situation on "Free Birds'" side was somewhat pathetic. Crane was beaten to a pulp, with armor and feathers damaged to varying degrees and needing a long time to recover. Dove and Falcon naturally go without saying—they were respectively defeated by their opponents and were thoroughly convinced by their loss.

"Really? I don't believe it."

"Believe it or not," Owl told me. "They're our own people; usually leave them some face and don't mention this matter in front of them again—people need space to grow."

I highly agreed with his last sentence; I thought so too.

"So, is that it for this matter?"

"Of course not," Owl was very certain of this. "At most, it can only be considered a comma; there are still too many things waiting for us to discover and understand. No matter who the ultimate beneficiary is, we at least need to know the reason for them doing so."

"Is pure revenge possible?"

"Before the truth is clear, everything is possible."

Thus, this assignment ended with a perfect comma. From the contemplative postures of everyone, it seemed as if there was still something placed on the table that we had overlooked, or rather, hadn't noticed at all, thinking its existence was reasonable.

"Um, I'll take the liberty to ask a question." One of the responsibilities of the [Support Position] is to remind: "The newcomer who first came to commission us—has anyone here looked into them?"

The people present shook their heads in succession; no one knew that newcomer. At the same time, Owl stood up, slapped his forehead, and suddenly realized: "That's right, we haven't determined his identity... we were all in a misunderstanding before, thinking the culprit was Plutomon, but what if he's not?"

"Moreover, we don't even know what his Digimon form is," I continued to add from the side.

As the representative of "Beast King's Fang," Xiao Yong had a general idea after hearing our introduction and could basically determine the identity of that person. He then introduced him to us: "That guy is indeed a newcomer, named Solomon. His digital image is a Psychemon. He's considered one of the newcomers who's relatively close to our Guild Master, often running errands for him. He's got a good reputation in the guild, and we all quite like him."

"That makes sense then." Owl said, snapping fingers. "A Gabumon subspecies—except for the horn on the top of its head, there's no part of its body that needs metal to fill. Let's make a hypothesis: if he were just an ordinary newcomer with a decent reputation in the guild, even if the horn on his head broke one day, he wouldn't be in such a hurry to find us and request that we take him to 'Hephaestus Workshop' to find Master Nagasumi. Ask anyone in the guild and they'd know where the place is..."

"Reasonable."

Kuin sat up straight and took over Owl's words. Holding the glass in her hand, she expanded her deduction: "If, I'm saying if, that newcomer named Solomon—what if he's Plutomon's man?"

"Then it returns to the starting point," Captain Agnes answered her bluntly. "Nothing has changed."

"So, only if he works for the person who truly benefits can everything make sense."

Xiao Yong didn't quite understand and asked Kuin sitting next to him: "How can you tell?"

"Think about it," Kuin put forward a new line of thinking for us. "What kind of role is he responsible for playing in this matter? A runner, someone who could enable 'Free Birds' to intervene in the bird-beast struggle and participate in it, and a character who is hostile to the mediation organization. In other words, although he is only a pawn in the hands of the beneficiary, the position he occupies is quite important. With him, this thing can succeed."

For a moment, everyone fell into contemplation, and the atmosphere was inexplicably quiet. Master Adam passed by us with two empty wine glasses. Seeing us all in such a serious state of thinking, he couldn't help but join in, and as soon as he spoke, he shocked us deeply.

"Having heard you say so much, if you ask me, this matter was clearly done by Jack of [Nether Club]."

I hurriedly stopped him and asked: "No, boss, why can you be so certain?"

"That's easy. I've heard him mention it before." He couldn't help but sigh. "You guys just came to the Atrium a few days late and missed all the guild conflicts and personal grudges between Guild Masters. That guy used to be at odds with Wind. Actually, strictly speaking, during that time, except for me, basically none of the other nine Guild Masters could look at each other favorably. They often quarreled over trifles, big and small... Don't mind my harsh words, none of those nine is a simple character, and none is a good person."

Hearing this, a look of embarrassment appeared on Xiao Yong's face: "You're... truly transparent."

"Ultra is the same, paranoid to a certain extent." Master Adam subconsciously supported his forehead, and his expression truly didn't look beautiful: "At the very beginning, he was the first to start having discord with Wind. I remember, in the most serious instance, the two of them directly fought as humans. I didn't expect that a big man like him would actually take a woman seriously. No matter how much I pulled, they wouldn't separate. More importantly, those punches landing on the other's face were truly something; he didn't hold back a speck of strength. The most excessive part is that this kind of conflict erupted not once or twice. One time, it even made its way to my place..."

"Then you..."

"I cleaned them both up and threw them out. If they dared to come to my place again, I'd clean them up every time I saw them."

Xiao Yong raised an eyebrow and casually muttered: "No wonder the Guild Master sent me to act for him—turned out he was afraid of getting beaten."

With the boss's words, we could basically lock onto another suspect of this incident, Jack. About him, we only knew he was "mysterious," and didn't know anything else; not only us, but the regulars in the bar were the same.

"Take my advice," Master Adam rarely showed a serious manner. "Don't go looking for him, and don't mention him in public for no reason. His eyes and ears are all over the Atrium. Once you offend him, you're destined not to be able to handle it, unless you're seeking death."

As the sister of the Master, Kuin raised a question on our behalf: "He... is very powerful?"

"More than powerful; more importantly, he's dangerous, no matter in which world." After saying this meaningfully, Master Adam snapped his fingers, signaling the bartender to bring another glass of wine for our table.

"Brother, why didn't I hear you mention him before?"

"At time, you were all very weak and hadn't grown up. Naturally, you wouldn't provoke dangerous people or come into contact with dangerous things, especially things concerning human lives."

Speaking of this, Master Adam coughed twice and took the initiative to change the subject: "Voltobautamon Jack—with your current strength, you're not yet enough to be his opponent. You should know, Plutomon being instantly killed by him didn't depend all on luck; it depended more on his own terrifying strength."

Master Adam suggested that if we still wanted to know the truth behind the matter, we could try to find X (埃克斯), the top talent of [Nether Club]. He was like another version of himself in [Nether Club], knowing everything.

Agnes had concerns about this: "I've heard people say that guy doesn't have a particularly good temper, and more importantly, his face looks rather scary. Going to find him and probe him might not be that easy."

"Don't be afraid." Master Adam offered another trick for us. "His weakness, in the eyes of us Guild Masters, is practically common knowledge. Recalling back then, Master Muca used to discipline every junior who spoke rudely to him upon first meeting—he always stopped when he had the upper hand. Only X was an exception; he was beaten so miserably that a deep psychological shadow was left on him, which he hasn't been able to forget for many years. So, if during your contact with him, you feel his attitude toward you isn't particularly friendly, you can try using the name '疤爷' (Ba-ye/Master Muca) to intimidate him."

"But, Brother, didn't Master Muca pass away long ago?"

"Yeah, but that guy still feels 'Ba-ye' is living in his heart, ready to lash him at any moment."

After everyone's discussion, we finally reached a consensus: the subsequent part of this matter would continue to be deeply investigated by Captain Agnes, who volunteered, and the [Five Nordic Countries Raiders] she led. Kuin originally wanted to join too, but first, she was stopped by her brother Master Adam, and second, she was busy handling the affairs of the [UN Five Permanent Members Raiders]. According to her, among the five of them, she's the only one free now.

"What about the other four?"

"Dragon and Zero have gone who-knows-where, Lana has to accompany their Poseidon, and Ment is busy rushing a report, leaving only your poor sister to do the work of five alone, being bossed around by the head."

Owl chimed in appropriately: "If you feel like you can't handle it alone, you can slightly depend on us."

"You?" Kuin showed a bit of disdain toward Owl. "Stop joking. In 'Free Birds', the only ones truly 'free' now are you two. I don't want to be the third wheel. If you have the time, help my brother clear up those people who owe debts every day, and take more care of him for me."

"We're not nannies."

"Just treat it as my request." Kuin said, glanced at her brother sitting beside her, and bumped him gently: "The bar will be closed for a week starting next week. Someone's going to have surgery. The doctor and bed have already been arranged for him. Go there and directly state my name. In a while, after I finish the affairs at the [Raiders] side, I'll bring a flower basket to visit him."

The sibling affection between them was truly enviable.

After parting, Owl went to visit the remaining three injured members of "Free Birds." I stayed at the bar, helping the boss clear the empty glasses on the table and handling the aftermath.

"By the way, Master, I had to use the 'Promotion Seed' you gave me earlier. I know this thing is very valuable and rare, so just treat it as if I owe you. In the future, if there's an opportunity, I'll definitely..."

"No need to pay it back."

"Eh?" I'm sure I didn't hear it wrong.

"That one, strictly speaking, isn't mine." Master Adam said: "Back then, just after the 'Promotion Seed' was designed, Master Muca unexpectedly obtained one. He believed the strong don't need this stuff, so he left it with me, saying that in the future, if I also became a strong person like him and didn't need this thing anymore, I should give it away, to someone who truly needs it."

It was treated like some kind of token, passed down to me through the hands of the two masters.

"Master, about the 'Master Muca' you talk about—I've asked Owl many times before, and he never told me. Can you tell me the story about him?"

"Certainly. I see you've almost finished clearing up. Shall we drink and chat?"
"Sure."
"Please."
