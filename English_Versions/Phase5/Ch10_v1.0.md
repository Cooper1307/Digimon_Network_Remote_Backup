# Chapter 10: Roaring Waves (第十章 狂涛怒啸)

Owl's removal from the field boosted their morale and, at the same time, ignited our fighting spirit.

Both sides engaged in a death-struggle within the confines of the giant whirlpool. Falcon went to deal with Lana, while the remaining Crane, myself, and our client Pufferfishmon took on the "Amphibious Brothers" (三栖兄弟) as a trio.

Saber against trident, Wolf against Mermaid—what sparked was no longer just fire but grains of crushed ice. "Geki Iogetsuga" (激·冰月牙) clashed head-on with "Crystalline Wild Waves," and before we knew it, a layer of ice mist shrouded the already cramped center of the whirlpool. Peering through the mist, one could see a Mastemon (莫斯提兽) dodging the massive devouring jaws of a MetalSeadramon. She continuously sent arrows of light from her right arm, only for them to be smashed by the wave cannons fired by the opponent. Not far from them, Pufferfishmon unleashed his "Spike Storm" (刺针暴风), followed by a "British Punch" (英国重拳) hitting the MetalSeadramon's muzzle, instantly silencing it. Observing his move, I began to follow suit; facing the muzzle turning toward me, I used my relative agility and "Thorn Whip" (荆棘之鞭) to entangle its mouth, rushing the muzzle with my "Rose Rapier" (蔷薇突刺剑) the moment it finished charging.

MetalSeadramon let out a shrill cry of pain. Following that, the energy storage device inside its muzzle was destroyed, causing the energy to break through the metal muzzle's constraints and scatter in all directions. Finally, with my "Forbidden Temptation" (禁断诱惑), he was completely put out of his misery. Thick black smoke billowed from the ruptured muzzle, and the massive body tilted to one side, slowly falling toward the seabed along the whirlpool wall.

"Great job, Sakura!"

Crane was the first to send me her praise. Without being modest, I, as the [Support Position], had given them a great start.

With one brother defeated, the other two wouldn't be doing well either. They both turned their heads, abandoned their previous opponents, and relocked their sights on me, harboring rage and swearing to avenge their brother. Of course, if they wanted to move against me, they'd have to ask the others if they agreed.

Crane flapped the five pairs of wings on her back, caught up at full speed, and used the "Dark Despair" (黑暗绝望) on her left arm to face the head-on impact of the "Ultimate Wave Cannon." The energy of the wave cannon came from within the MetalSeadramon's body; like itself, it was composed of data and could also be deleted as fragmented data by Crane's left hand. Realizing this, Crane, once certain she could continue to resist, headed toward the muzzle and ended another one using the same "muzzle-blocking" method I had.

"Only one left," Crane said, proactively sending me an invitation. "Let's take it on together, Sakura."

I would never refuse such a request.

However, things didn't go as smoothly as we expected. Due to the successive defeats of its two brothers, the last one was unwilling to fall into the same fate and was exceptionally desperate and powerful. Even when "Thorn Whip" was passed through its head-knife hole, it could actually shake us off its head, showing its rage had reached its peak.

Finally, with no other way and to preserve our lives and the client's from being harmed by this frenzied MetalSeadramon, Crane was forced to unleash her ultimate move—"Chaos Degradation" (混沌降阶).

"Sorry, I didn't want to do this..."

Crane rarely showed her gentle side. Seeing the opponent refusing to settle down, she finally steeled her heart and sent out the light and dark energy gathered in her left and right hands. The two merged, gradually producing a dimensional gate that would suck in everything around it and bury it completely.

"It's over." I stretched and let out a long sigh, just about to show a relaxed mood when private frightened by a voice coming from behind in the next second.

"It's far from over!"

Looking back at the source of the voice, there seemed to be something behind the water wall. Subsequently, a harpoon suddenly lunged out from behind the wall, its speed so fast the naked eye could barely catch it, directly piercing through the energy center and preventing the dimensional gate from manifesting. The resulting violent explosion directly dispersed the water wall of the giant whirlpool, calming all the vortices and currents before our eyes.

Afterward, the harpoon returned to its owner's hand. Looking in its direction, we caught sight of the figure hidden behind the water wall. Like Lana's AncientMermaimon, a long fish tail trailed behind him, but it was much thicker than Lana's slender version. He was covered in scale armor made of blue alloy, and his overall presence was extraordinary, giving off a very majestic feeling. Just by his appearance, one could conclude: he was a strong one.

"I wondered who dared to be so insolent at my doorstep. So it's a bunch of small, free birds, oh? And a cockroach was left out."

"You're the cockroach..."

Pufferfishmon managed to utter these words, but his retort sounded so weak and powerless at that moment.

The fact that he could speak underwater proved he was a King of the aquatic types, no less than the other four. Having saved one of the "Amphibious Brothers" with a single move, his strength was not to be underestimated. Seeing us affected by the explosion, shaken and losing our fighting spirit, and dazed by the strong sea current, he no longer bothered with us, instead turning his spearhead toward Falcon, who was currently in a duel with Lana. In his words, one could insult him, but bullying his woman was absolutely forbidden.

Unexpectedly, he was Poseidon, the Guild Master of [Atlantis], or should be called the King of the Deep Sea Temple—Neptunemon (尼普顿兽). Instinct told us that Falcon was about to meet a very miserable end.

At this thought, Crane grabbed my hand and pointed her other hand in Falcon's direction, seemingly signaling me to go save him. I immediately understood and, dragging my rapidly recovering body, swam toward Falcon. The Queen of Flowers could recover with just water; whenever conditions allowed, it was sometimes just that convenient.

By the time I arrived, Falcon had already endured a beating. He was being poked in the neck by the aquatic couple from front and back, unable to breathe and struggling continuously in the water. The Yellow Beast Scimitar in his hand had already fallen elsewhere, stuck in deep-sea coral far from him—it took me a long time to pull it out.

I was just about to go help him when a sudden violent noise came from above, followed by a surging current that almost washed me away again. Fortunately, I had the Yellow Beast Scimitar; using it to anchor myself to something was safer than anything. Looking up, a "Giglio" (巨人导弹) was shot into the sea and detonated by the action of a "Dark Gaia Force" (黑暗盖亚能量炮), the resulting impact forcing the couple to release their prey to save themselves.

After the explosion, Owl dived back into the seabed, protecting his little brother Falcon and telling him to retreat to the surface first and join Dove, while he stayed behind to deal with this savage couple.

"Who are you calling savage!"

Lana was a thousand times unwilling after hearing his address for them. Just as she was about to flare up, she was stopped by Poseidon's hand: "Dear, don't get angry with savage intruders. Just find a way to kill them."

With those words, both sides immediately started fighting.

One against two, Owl was always at a disadvantage. I could never intervene in a battle between the strong, nor could I; for now, the distance between them and me was actually still very large—I could just see them. They could be lively and vigorous underwater, but I couldn't, after all, my power was limited and I couldn't easily overcome water pressure and currents, but that didn't mean I would choose to wait for death. Distracting the enemy was also a form of [Support].

Flicking out the Thorn Whip in my left hand to bind Lana, I released high-voltage electric shocks to temporarily restrict her. This way, Poseidon wouldn't be able to put all his attention on Owl, and Owl could seize the chance to use "Black War Tornado" (黑暗战斗龙卷风) to defeat the opponent in one go.

However, I seemed to have forgotten to consider one point: Owl's opponent was a Guild Master, and dealing with him wasn't that easy. What I absolutely hadn't expected was that the fish-headed harpoon in his hand, named "King's Bite" (王者锐刺), actually had its own thoughts. After being thrown by its master, it could change its direction of movement in the water by itself, find the thorn vine binding its master's wife, and bite it through with the "Dreadful Bite" at its head, bringing her freedom once again.

"Dear, I'll leave the girl over there to you."

"No problem. You keep an eye out on your side too; the captain of the 'Free Birds' is quite troublesome."

"Haha, I'll let him see what a Guild Master I am!"

Meeting the representative of the British [Raiders] was my honor. Unfortunately, I love peace and didn't want to get too involved with her, especially when the client was nowhere to be seen—to put it bluntly, I felt it was unnecessary.

She took up her trident and rushed toward me aggressively. I had no choice but to engage. I released a long string of vines in advance and used it to churn the sea water, creating a whirlpool to attack her, but she was completely unaffected and maintained her fast speed toward me.

If anyone thought my strength was only this much, they were greatly mistaken.

Since I knew she was an aquatic type, I naturally wouldn't use moves that wouldn't have much effect on her. The purpose of such churning was actually just to lure her into my trap, and then I tightened the grip, and she was bound by me again. She had to cooperate, or the high-voltage current wouldn't let her off easily.

By right, if you're a prisoner, you should behave and not cause more trouble. However, this woman named Lana gave me an education; her lack of making things easy reached a certain level. Using her mermaid advantage, she continuously dragged me, who had her bound, through the water, presumably with the aim of distracting my attention so I wouldn't have time to worry about the two men above. I kept a relatively safe distance from her at all times, preventing her from knocking me out with her fish tail. Gradually, I couldn't stand her anymore; being underwater and unable to give her verbal threats, I had to show her the Yellow Beast Scimitar in my hand, after which she became much quieter.

Honestly, if only she'd been like that from the start!

To prevent her from launching a sneak attack when I wasn't looking, I used "Rosy Cradle" (玫瑰色摇篮) to hypnotize her, so I could free my hands, coil her fish tail onto her trident, and let her take a nap on the seabed alone, so I could find the time to go up and help Owl. He was currently in a brief crisis—I didn't know if it was because of attribute disadvantage or because he was unfamiliar with the ocean terrain, but he was pinned firmly to a reef by Poseidon with the harpoon in his hand. The fish-headed spear tip was continuously gnawing at his arms, and the connection between the arm and the "Dramon Killer" (龙兽克星) was also being gnawed at pathetically; he had unilaterally become the bullied party, looking more than a bit aggrieved.

How could I watch my hero suffer such a grievance? A "Thorn Whip" lash hit his fish tail—specifically, his butt—successfully attracting his attention.

Owl couldn't have been more confused by my death-seeking behavior. Of course, that was my guess; don't expect to see any expression on a BlackWarGreymon's face—the same for other types of Digimon.

"Little girl, you shouldn't direct your anger at a King."

"And you shouldn't humiliate my hero in front of me."

In the water, these words naturally couldn't be spoken, so I could only prove it with my actual actions; "Forbidden Temptation" was the best example. Although it was blocked by Poseidon spinning the harpoon in his hand, it gave me enough opportunity to deliver the Yellow Beast Scimitar in my hand to my hero.

"Slay him!"

My eyes said this to Owl, and I hoped he could understand.

He detached the "Dramon Killer" mounted on his arms, took the Yellow Beast Scimitar I had sent, and immediately regained his spirit. Seeing this, Poseidon's face looked a bit panicked, but it was quickly restored.

"Think I'm afraid of you just because you changed weapons? Take this—"

Just as he said, changing weapons didn't completely hold him off, but at least he could go back and forth with him in the water and not fall into the position of being beaten.

The two strong ones continued to fight. Gradually, Guild Master Poseidon lost his patience, anxious to decide the outcome and find his other half. Seizing the opportunity when the harpoon held the scimitar, he used "Atlantis Gate" (亚特兰蒂斯之门) on Owl, summoning a massive water column for a head-on attack. Its power was no less than a single "Ultimate Wave Cannon." Even with Owl holding the Yellow Beast Scimitar for defense, he was sent a long distance away, finally hitting a nearby reef and floating down from the water like a seashell.

Arriving at his wife's side and finding her unconscious, Guild Master Poseidon could no longer suppress his emotions. Without waiting for my gesticulating explanation, he unleashed that "Vortex Piercer" (漩涡穿刺)—the one capable of piercing even a dimensional gate—at me.

Its speed was as swift as lightning; released one second, it was already before my eyes the next. I had no time to dodge. Seeing the spear tip about to hit, a yo-yo suddenly flashed before my eyes, parrying those fatal tips for me. Following it, a familiar voice came from behind me: "Guild Master Poseidon is quite heartless to our people. I'm afraid you want to proactively trigger a struggle between guilds."

The one who saved me was none other than the Guild Master of [Natural Garden] (自然庭院), Flower. Her appearance was quite unexpected, but as long as she was here, Guild Master Poseidon wouldn't dare move against me, unless he wanted to take on two—strictly speaking, three, as Owl had regained his fighting spirit by then.

"You really have the face to say that!" Poseidon shouted at us furiously. "The ones who invaded are clearly you. Look at the surroundings—a perfectly good 'Network Sea' is now a mess because of you. I think you're looking for trouble on purpose, coming here specifically to fight me!"

Guild Master Flower didn't think so. She put on a delicate appearance, took my arm as if I were her sister, hid behind my body, and said to her old acquaintance Poseidon: "From what I see, they don't have the time. As for me—a routine inspection, just going around and seeing if any Guild Master is arbitrarily picking fights and forgetting the parting instructions of Senior 'Muca' (幕疤), wanting to engage in that mutual opposition thing... Oh dear, I didn't say it was you, don't mind it."

Her words undoubtedly alerted the opponent.

"You're as despicable as ever, Flower, actually daring to use Senior 'Muca' to pressure me."

"It's because you yourself don't have a good memory and need me to remind you."

I didn't quite understand who this "Muca" they mentioned was. Whenever this name was brought up, the tone of both of them would involuntarily become respectful.

"Fine, count this as your win!" Poseidon swallowed a breath of unwillingness and said: "For the sake of Senior 'Muca', I'll let you off today. But remember this! From now on, don't you dare step one foot into the 'Network Sea' again! Otherwise, even if you escape back to reality, I won't let you off!"

"Thank you for your understanding, Guild Master Poseidon. We won't disturb your time as a couple. We'll take our leave."

Afterward, Guild Master Flower quickly pulled me and Owl and dived into the spatial tunnel she had cut for a timely evacuation. I asked her why she was in such a hurry, and she said she was worried Poseidon would change his mind.

"Don't believe any promise that guy makes; there's no telling when he'll forget."

Looking at it this way, we were quite lucky. It was fortunate Guild Master Flower came to save the day, otherwise, I wouldn't dare think about what might have happened or what a dangerous situation we would have encountered.

"By the way, Master, why did you come?"

"Little Snake told me to. She accidentally heard someone talking about the 'Amphibious Brothers' in the bar, saying they were patrolling the waters near the Deep Sea Temple. As soon as she thought of you, she hurried to find me for help, so I came."

As it turned out, she was one step late and happened to run into the Guild Master of [Atlantis].

"Then she..."

"Went back to drinking. Her tolerance is quite high; she often boasts to us that she could drink [A Cup of Bar] into bankruptcy single-handedly. Just don't tell the owner about this, or he'll raise the price again."

How should I put it? These two short sentences of dialogue had too many points for complaints—I didn't know which part to start with.

Our business came to a temporary close. With Guild Master Flower's support, the request was successfully completed. Pufferfishmon finally saw the person of his heart—a MarinAngemon (海天使兽).

"Want to know why our client was so persistent?"

I became interested in the question Owl posed: "Tell me."

"Because both of them are like you—their 'User Identification Medal' devices were accidentally destroyed, and they can only stay in this world composed of data. This place is their everything."

This place was my everything, too.

Pufferfishmon fell in love with someone in the Deep Sea Temple, a MarinAngemon.

Because they were once too small and weak to explore and survive in the Digital World together, they had to rely on the strong to survive. Pufferfishmon chose the [Mutation Institute] (突变研究所), and MarinAngemon chose [Atlantis]. Before parting, the two made a pact: no matter who obtained power first, they must not forget the other, must go to the other's guild to find them, must always worry about them, and must not forget them.

Such a story sounds very romantic, but in reality, it's a form of invisible restraint. Just like the lonely me—there are always those days when Owl and the other companions of the "Free Birds" log out of the Atrium and return to reality to enjoy their lives and their journey, while I can only stay here alone with a bar owner named Adam, giving him a hand as a barmaid and taking care of these adults who are like infants.

Boring yet fulfilling; perhaps that is what life is.
