# Chapter 13: Final Judgment (第十三章 最终审判)

I roughly understood what she meant. To be honest, such a tactic was despicable. First, put on a show with Ultra to create a picture of the two major guilds being hostile to each other, and then send a "messenger" who had long been in contact with "Free Birds" to inform them, draw them over, and get them on our side, openly becoming enemies with the mediation organization—it was simply too crazy.

"What if you all can't beat the ten Mediators..."

"Then it's your turn to step up."

She meant for me to do the backstabbing thing, which was exactly my intention.

Clearly, she was using me. Using me to show up at the last minute and harvest heads—if it succeeded, everyone would be happy; if it failed, the blame would fall on me. I would become the target of public criticism, treated as the villain by everyone. Even if I confessed that she and Ultra were the masterminds, no one would believe me by then. I must say, her wishful thinking was great, but it was used in the wrong place and on the wrong person. Thus, I decided to take this opportunity to take a good revenge on her.

I didn't want to be the big fish that ended the struggle between shrimp and crabs, but the fisherman who netted them all without much effort and gained the ultimate benefit. Therefore, I needed a good bait that could net them all.

Things were settled this way.

Ten days later, I received a package from Ukraine. Inside was a dried head—judging by the hair length, it looked like a woman's. There was also a letter, written by Jack's subordinate, a mercenary leader. The letter said the owner of the head was the civilian hypnotist named Aurora—in other words, the Wind Master we often talked about. Attached below was her identity verification card. What to do next would depend on my own arrangements.

The development of things to this point was completely beyond my expectation.

Also revenge, also taking human life—clearly it could be done in the Digital World without leaving a trace, yet he chose to do it in the real world. I didn't understand why. With what I knew about Jack, even if I logged into the Atrium and found him to question him face-to-face about what happened, he would put on an air of knowing nothing and tell me it might be the personal behavior of his subordinates, and since he never paid for personal behavior, he naturally couldn't give a reasonable explanation. At most, he would show some humanitarian care, hypocritically mourn for a couple of sentences, put his hypocrisy on the table to disgust you, and you would never know what he was calculating from beginning to end.

On the back of the letter was written one sentence: You're welcome.

His methods were truly high—it was practically written on his face as "My doing." In this way, a meticulous plan, accurate timing, and a reliable executor—all three conditions were met for a seamless revenge.

Having obtained Wind's account, I logged in and came into contact with Ultra. He didn't suspect my identity at all and still treated me as his good neighbor. The plan proceeded step by step. Clearly, Wind gave Owl a psychological suggestion before she died, or rather, Jack sent someone to take Wind's head after she gave Owl the psychological suggestion. The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind—but when it came to me, I was the oriole having to play the part of the eaten cicada myself. More importantly, the one targeting me was Ceresmon (刻瑞斯兽), who, like the current me, was a giant bird.

Fortunately, I had understood the opponent's weakness in advance—it was her main body, the "Ceresmon Medium" (刻瑞斯兽 灵媒) located at her head, which looked very much like a human. She had a very terrifying skill called "Hunger," which could manipulate the plants she grew to suck out the opponent's energy until all the data was drained. The Ornismon (奥尼斯兽) I played as unfortunately fell victim to this skill; not only were the released "Cosmic Rays" completely sucked away, but the entire image of the Digimon turned into pieces of data, slowly disappearing and ceasing to exist.

Being inside the Atrium and not part of the external Digital World, death didn't mean the complete end. For the current me, it meant a comeback.

Forced back to reality, I took my own identity verification card, inserted it and logged in again, returning as Plutomon (普路托兽) and easily harvesting Ceresmon's head with just one move, "Wild Bunch" (野性丛集).

The progress continued to advance.

Kidnap Dianamon (狄安娜兽), deal with Apollomon (阿波罗兽), and prevent them from fusion-evolving into Gracenovamon (优雅新星兽)—the remaining two girls from "Rainbow Starlight" naturally wouldn't be my match. We were fighting happily in the sky, and no one below could see what was happening above the cloud layer. I used a little trick, opening the "Hell's Gate," sent away Hououmon and her "Starlight Explosion," and simultaneously invaded a part of the data of AncientIrismon, destroying the "User Identification Medal" device in her body, making her completely a Digimon, falling from the sky, the trajectory of the fall naturally forming a beautiful rainbow.

After that, I went to visit my former sweetheart. She was also one of my targets for revenge. At this moment, she and Mastemon were locked in an embrace, each clutching the other's throat. Seeing the opportunity, I attacked them from behind, using a patch of Chaos as cover, letting them think it was each other's credit, and then hid in the cloud layer with a clear conscience, watching them slowly fall.

Arriving at the place where they fell, both ladies were dazed from the fall and lunged at each other with teeth and claws. I stepped forward and separated them, giving each a slap. They didn't calm down; instead, they became even more like shrews.

Mastemon was the first to lunge at me. She used her two proudest moves one after another—"Holy Desire" and "Dark Despair"—both of which were neutralized by me. Seeing she couldn't win quickly, she didn't think much and directly used her trump card ultimate "Chaos Degradation" on me. The resulting dimensional gate non-only failed to affect me but instead allowed some time for me to pull my former sweetheart into my arms and inject my core virus into her, letting her obtain the same otherworldly dark power as me and prompting her to complete a further breakthrough, evolving into Junomon: Hysteric Mode (朱诺兽：癔病形态).

In this form, she wouldn't be sensed by Jupitermon—in other words, I could make good use of her.

As expected of the girl I once set my eyes on, she didn't disappoint me. Using the needles on both hands, she easily destroyed the armor on Mastemon and pierced her body, putting her into a state of suspended animation where she couldn't move. She held her over her head like a trophy and dragged her a long distance. After confirming there were new prey nearby, she threw her away like garbage.

"A willful girl."

I casually let out this sentence and looked around, but didn't find anyone else nearby. When I realized that I might be the target, she had already wrapped her chains around me, preparing to pierce me just like the garbage she had just thrown out.

Honestly, at that moment, my heart ached, as if I had returned to the years when my heart was broken by her. I wanted to cry, but the tears in my heart had long since run dry back then, leaving only a heart full of hot blood.

To survive, I had no choice but to use "Chaos Light" to finish her off—finishing off the love from back then.

When I saw Jupitermon collapse due to her death, I realized that over these years, my goal had gradually shifted from that girl to the person by her side. Blinded by the thought of revenge, without realizing it, the weight he occupied in my heart had already far exceeded my beloved girl—this was undoubtedly a tragedy.

A tragedy created by my own hands, through and through.

# Gaiden 4: Subjugation of Plutomon (外传四 普路托兽讨伐战)

## (I)

-By Agnes-

My father arranged a blind date for me. I didn't really want to go, afraid I wouldn't find common topics with the man. Just as I was worried about not finding an excuse to decline, a reason came to my door.

The person who contacted me was my first boyfriend's younger sister, Aurélie Lefebvre, who was also my senior during university. She contacted me as the representative of the French [Raiders] (攻略组), attempting to persuade me to help her investigate someone. Originally, she wanted to follow the formal process and report the matter to the head of the [Raiders] for assignment, but the head was away, so she contacted me first.

"You've come to the right person."

I agreed readily without thinking.

"The target might not be an easy one, Agnes. Are you sure you won't reconsider?"

"By the time I finish considering, the prey will have flown away." I thanked her for her kind advice and told her: "Don't worry, the five Nordic countries are a team and always act together. I'll give you an answer once there's a lead."

I hung up the phone, ignored my old father's persuasion outside the door, shared the news with the representatives of the other four Nordic countries, and then locked the door. I came to the EDEN somatosensory device, wiped away the dust, inserted the identity verification card, and logged into the long-lost Atrium system. Sanhara was as beautiful as ever.

Switching to the form of Valkyrimon (瓦尔基里兽), I prepared to take to the sky to find the Wind Master and ask about the situation. Just as I was about to move, the golden bird "Freya" (芙蕾雅) stopped me, reminding me to be on alert—dangerous things were approaching nearby.

Hiding behind a massive rock and looking around, I soon saw a Plutomon (普路托兽). He was muttering to himself, all self-blaming words, as if he had just done something he felt sorry for.

I followed him all the way, hoping to hear some useful clues from his mouth, to save me from having to disturb our Master who loved chasing freedom and wind. I didn't know what was wrong with him, but he personally confessed all the crimes he had committed; including how he used Wind's identity verification card to log into the Atrium in her name and played "Free Birds" and the mediation organization in the palm of his hand.

Based on my intuition, he was the culprit I was looking for.

So I immediately stepped forward to negotiate with him. The reason I didn't act directly was that I still tried to believe that what he said just now was all nonsense. After questioning him for a while, he not only didn't answer a single question of mine but instead turned back and asked me: "Did you hear everything I said just now?"

I gave him an affirmative answer. He smiled at me a couple of times, ended with a contemptuous tone, and then stated that I knew too much about him—therefore, he was going to silence me and not let me go back alive to tell others. He also very gentlemanly told me to be ready to be finished off quickly by him.

"Please, is there any point in this nonsense?" I expressed my disdain to him. "Frankly, everyone is a Mega. Who are you trying to scare?"

In the next second, a patch of black Chaos emanated from behind him, he disappeared into it, and instantly appeared behind me. Fortunately, with Freya's timely reminder, his sneak attack didn't succeed. I made a prompt decision and pulled out the "Fenrir Sword" hanging on my left waist to counterattack.

The blade hit his hard body and instantly froze it. But in the blink of an eye, he was swallowed by that clump of black Chaos again, then returned to the state before freezing and reappeared before me.

"Is this all you've got?"

He subjected me to verbal humiliation. As a descendant of a "Valkyrie," how could I tolerate this? So, I fired the "Arrow of Aurvandil" (奥尔万迪尔之矢) at him, which never missed, but unexpectedly, he casually pulled a patch of Chaos from behind his back, turned it into a shield, and blocked it easily.

Not to exaggerate, but besides the team command I was best at, my skills as a [Support Position] were all used up here. It's hard to imagine someone like me actually becoming the captain of the [Five Nordic Countries Raiders]. Sometimes, I feel ashamed of myself.

Realizing that my low-level skills weren't enough to take him down alone, I immediately changed my strategy, retreating to defend and leading him toward inhabited areas, trying to create as much noise as possible and cause a commotion, so I could join up with the others as soon as possible. If the five of us were all present, I doubted he would be able to do anything no matter how much ability he had.

I was good at speed, so dodging was my specialty. Little did I know, it was also his.

He subjected me to a relentless pursuit and attack. Not only did I not gain any advantage, but I also ended up with injuries all over. I was frequently blasted from the sky to the ground, scrambled and hit trees, fell onto rocks—the scene was as pathetic as could be.

Holding my waist and lying on the ground, I gradually realized I might not reach inhabited areas, so I simply decided to turn back and risk my life for a final struggle, let's see whose life is harder.

It turned out his was harder.

I was abused by him to the point of being utterly broken, with no way to resist. My feathers were continuously burned by the black Chaos, and the pain of the burns made me scream again and again, but it only made him more excited, more wanting to pull a bird-person like me out of the data combination and completely infect my soul with his dangerous virus, becoming another scourge threatening the Atrium world.

I wanted to beg for mercy, but I couldn't open my mouth.
I wanted to run, but I couldn't move my legs.

Entering such a plight, being called "at death's door" was no exaggeration. I wasn't sure if his power was innate or if he had obtained it through effort; anyway, what I was certain of was that the black Chaos on him definitely didn't belong to the Atrium. In other words, the Atrium couldn't produce a monster like him.

"It's wonderful, right?" He leaned close to my ear and whispered to me: "This black thing gave me power. It cannot be destroyed by your ultimate skills, cannot be cleared as data, and cannot even be identified as a bug by the system. With it, no one is my match. Everyone blocking me will be swallowed by it and become its nourishment, allowing it to continuously provide me with power. And you, nothing more than a pre-meal dessert—I can tell it to be a bit gentler to you and not let you die so painfully."

"Doesn't it require me to pay some price?"

"Of course not," he replied neatly. "Erasing your existence is the price."

I increasingly felt that if his words were true, it's very likely that even if the five of us gathered, we wouldn't be able to do anything to him, because that patch of black Chaos would always block all fatal damage for him. Sometimes, it could even become transparent and give you a heavy blow from behind unexpectedly, becoming a weapon for backstabbing you.

"I want to know, where did you get such a treasure?"

Grit my teeth and struggled to ask this question. My physical strength was gradually being sucked away by it, and my spirit was gradually becoming withered. Even the vision before my eyes couldn't escape the influence, becoming blurred bit by bit.

"Like you, I want to know too."

He told me that back then, to pursue power beyond the mediation organization, he stepped into that desolate land in the Digital World and then honorably fainted. When he woke up, he found he possessed such miraculous power.

"...and by the way, completed a leap-frog evolution."

"Leap-frog? How... how is that possible?"

"Believe it or not," he expressed indifferently. "No executioner would lie to a dying person. It... indeed happened right on me. I wanted to figure out what was going on, too. Unfortunately, there still aren't enough talents in the Atrium world. Perhaps, at this very moment, someone has already hidden in their own territory, secretly researching and figuring it out."

From the beginning, he had ignored one thing: why I had fallen into such a state. Logically, in terms of speed, he and I were on par, and it would be hard to create a one-sided situation—unless "Freya," the golden bird that had been reminding me how to dodge the attacks from behind, had been sent out temporarily for other tasks. For example, to call someone, to lead the way—and what I needed to do was just to cooperate with it, entangle Plutomon, and gain some more time for it, waiting for my reinforcements to arrive.

Hard work paid off. Before my left arm was disabled, the first reinforcement arrived with the wind—it was the representative from Finland, the [Vanguard Position] Sleipmon (斯雷普兽). "Bifröst" (虹桥烈矢) was fired head-on from the sacred crossbow "Muspelheim" in his left hand. Plutomon couldn't dodge in time and had to take this blow honestly.

Upon arrival, he sent a meeting gift to our enemy, distracting him while also gaining enough time to rescue me. It seemed his [Vanguard Position] was quite reliable.

"You go quickly, I'll hold them off here."

After saying this, he was hit aside by the "Chaos Light" released by Plutomon. With the sacred shield "Niflheim" in his right hand as a block, the injury he received was minimal.

Seeing this, Plutomon naturally wouldn't give him too many chances to catch his breath. After continuously dropping two Chaos Bombs, our vanguard Sleipmon completely vanished into a patch of Chaos. By the time he was seen again, he had been forced to use his last-ditch ultimate skill "Odin's Breath," using the sacred shield "Niflheim" on his right hand to manipulate the nearby climate, triggering a blizzard to continuously compete with that patch of Chaos.

I didn't want to waste his kindness, so I hurried toward the town ahead as fast as possible. I firmly believed that once we reached inhabited areas, it would be our home field, and we would transform from the previous prey into the hunter. Of course, it's possible I was overthinking it.

From the later results, my team members were still very reliable.

After the [Vanguard Position] was defeated, Plutomon followed my pace and approached the outskirts of the town. The representative from Norway intervened; he was our [Defense Position] Olegmon (奥列格兽). In terms of reliability, the four of us combined weren't as good as him alone. One could say that with him around, our [Five Nordic Countries Raiders] were destined not to fail. Unfortunately, the pity was that this time he was fighting alone, and his opponent was a nearly invincible guy who excelled in both long-range and close-range combat, and had that patch of black Chaos that could immunize him from all attribute damage as a guardian. No matter how heavyweight Olegmon was or how strong the brute force he used, it was difficult to make a breakthrough. The final result could only end in a unilateral defeat.

Bursting into the town, I shouted and called for help. However, the people here were either rookies who had just completed their guild registration or Ultimates who had spent some time outside and came here for recuperation—relying on them was impossible. They were also very sensible; seeing us coming, they moved out of the way very smoothly, without a single word of complaint, presumably already scared out of their wits.

Passing through a marketplace, I was tripped by a shoulder pole in the middle of the road. Looking back, Plutomon's right index finger was pointing right at my brow, less than half a fist away. At the critical moment, two massive war hammers flew from a street on one side, hitting and blowing away Plutomon, who was about to move against me.

Looking over through the fleeing crowd, a familiar figure appeared before me, panting and chewing a mouthful of something brown. He looked as honest and cute as he did when I first met him.

"Puff... puff... finally, finally... caught—caught up—"

He was from Iceland, our newly promoted [Substitute Position] Vikemon (维京兽). In matters like "rescuing one's own people in distress," how could a gallant hero for justice be late?

As soon as he opened his mouth, he brought me a piece of news with a somewhat sad undertone: "Freyr (弗雷尔) had a bad stomach last night, didn't bring paper when he went to the toilet, and told us to wait for him a while. He'll come to join us after he's air-dried."

I could even smell it from his words.

Hard to imagine how I had promoted such a guy into the [Raiders]. Saying such words with a mouth full of chocolate—didn't he feel disgusted?

## (II)

-By Freyr-

I am Freyr, from Copenhagen, Denmark. Currently working at the St. Knute's Church where Hans Christian Andersen was baptized. I don't like fairy tales and yearn for a lonely life where I'm the only person in the world. Perhaps it's because I'm used to being bullied by those guys around me.

Actually, I could never figure out why I was usually targeted. Simply because I have a good temper? Perhaps so—who wouldn't want to pick a person with a good temper to bully? As long as it's not particularly excessive, the most I would do is say a couple of words to them in person; if it's particularly excessive, it's actually fine—at most, I'd curse them with a few more swear words. I suddenly realized, do I usually give them too much of a good face, to the point that they think I won't get angry? Perhaps—getting a conclusion on such a thing requires picking an opportunity for a test, and I am a person who hates trouble. If I were even a bit more diligent, I wouldn't be holding a graduation certificate from the University of Copenhagen and working as a church gatekeeper.

That Sunday, I was patrolling near the church as usual, picking up trash and watching tourists show off their affection. Bored, I pulled out my phone to check messages. Captain Agnes had contacted us, telling us to log on as soon as possible for a new mission.

The remaining three respectively expressed they had received it or were "on the way." Not following their formation would make me look out of place, which wasn't appropriate. However, my EDEN somatosensory device was still at my home in Vansenvej, Copenhagen, which was a certain distance from where I worked. How far? Let me put it this way: geographically, they weren't even on the same island. Driving back would take me at least two and a half hours.

I can't not do my job; it determines whether I will starve in reality. But I also can't not execute the mission; my absence might lead to task failure and the death of team members. I couldn't bear the responsibility related to lives, so I decisively chose the latter.

I wanted to retract the message I just sent, but they had already seen it. Distance destined that I would be late; I had to weave a suitable reason for myself in advance. So, I contacted the newly joined [Substitute Position] rookie in private, telling him I had a party with friends last night, had a bad stomach, and woke up at noon today, was currently stuck in the toilet, and had forgotten to bring paper—told them to wait for me a while.
