# Chapter 1: The Ebon Hero

My mother passed away unexpectedly, leaving me without my only remaining kin.

In her will—penned while she yet lived—she transferred her Midgard account to my name. It had been active for less than seventy-two hours in the physical world, yet she hoped it would offer me solace in her stead, keeping the shroud of loneliness at bay.

I set aside my research papers, requested leave from my advisor, and departed Tokyo for my long-forsaken hometown of Kyoto. Everything remained exactly as I remembered it. My neighbors were waiting for me; they helped arrange the mortician and saw to my mother’s final rites.

"How did she die?" I asked.

"We don't know," my neighbor replied. "The police said it appeared to be sudden cardiac arrest."

Sudden death? How absurd a way to go—not even granted a final glimpse of the world.

After saying my final goodbyes, I went to her room to settle her affairs. Tucked beneath her pillow, I found a diary. It was a record of her past—most of it chronicling her adventures in Midgard, where she had assumed the form of a Digimon.

"Lalamon... Woodmon... Lilamon..."

I whispered the names one by one. From her beginnings as a Rookie to her ascent to the Ultimate level, the pages were a testament to her long struggle.

Through her entries, I began to understand her life within Midgard. She had been a member of the **Sylvan Garden Guild** and had forged a pact with a user named Snake: whoever could evolve their Lilamon into its Mega level first would earn the right to campaign for the position of the next Guild Master.

*“A day in the Digital World equals a minute in reality.”*

If that rule held true, she had been immersed in that world for at least ten years. According to her diary, a decade was more than enough time for a Digimon to climb from the Rookie stage to the Mega level. If one were diligent and took on enough guild commissions, eight or nine years would suffice. In other words, this "Snake" had surely already secured the right to the candidacy—perhaps they were already the Guild Master.

I inherited my mother’s fierce competitive streak. Knowing her, had she still been alive, she never would have let Snake best her. A surge of indignation rose within me. I decided then and there to find Snake and settle the score.

Following the clues left on the final page of the diary, I climbed into the attic of our old house. I waded through a mountain of junk shrouded in plastic until I finally unearthed her EDEN sensory immersion rig. It looked remarkably new, free of dust; she couldn't have used it for long.

I pulled out the manual, connected the power, and inserted the authentication card she had prepared for me. Once the system verified my identity, a sudden flash of light blinded me. By the time I regained my senses, my body had already transitioned into a completely new space.

Clicking the button on the left, I felt a sudden surge of power propel me forward, merging my consciousness into the data stream. The journey was faster than a rocket; in the blink of an eye, I had successfully logged into the Midgard system and arrived at this vast tourist hub.
