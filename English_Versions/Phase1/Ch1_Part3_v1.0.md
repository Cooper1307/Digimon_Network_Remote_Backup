Blissfully ignorant, I stepped through the data wall into the outer world. My attention was entirely fixed on my new self—until I realized I had wandered into a dense forest and was quite "gloriously" lost.

Glancing back, the data wall was still visible, its surface scrolling with mundane social news from the Digital World. It was all the same nonsense: one tribe declaring war on another over a stolen turnip; another group swimming straight into a Whamon’s mouth; or a "rebel human faction" being infiltrated and pummeled by pro-human operatives in Digimon forms. Things that would be scandals in the human world were just everyday trivia here.

*I know where the data wall is,* I told myself. *As long as I keep my bearings, I’ll be fine. I might as well explore a bit before heading back to the guild to find Snake.*

But I had underestimated the forest. The bizarre, twisted trees soon blurred into a confusing maze, and within minutes, the towering data wall was gone. I was utterly lost. Disoriented, I stumbled through the gloom, making no progress toward an exit. Instead, I succeeded only in getting hit squarely on the head by a piece of falling fruit.

"Ow... that really hurts..."

I was clutching my head, rolling on the ground in pain, when a face appeared above me, clearly having waited for some time. It was a face that could only be described as loathsome. His teeth were a stained, sickly yellow; dark sunglasses masked his eyes; a WaruMonzaemon plush dangled from his waist. With a rose clenched in his teeth and a microphone in hand, he belted out a tune that was pure acoustic torture. He was the absolute embodiment of the word "greasy."

"Does my lady have a headache?" he asked, his voice dripping with mock-concern. "Or perhaps... you are simply dazed by my beauty?"

I slapped him. Forgive me—I couldn't help it.

But the result was not what I expected. Despite the full force of my blow, he didn't even flinch. He didn’t show a hint of pain or even an acknowledgment of the insult. Instead, he grinned wider, leaning in closer. "Oh, poor thing. Does your hand hurt? Do you need me to rub it for you?"

"Get away from me!" I scrambled back, clutching my chest to guard myself.

"Ooh, a feisty one. I like that." He snapped his fingers and gave a theatrical, mock-gentlemanly bow. "I trust my **'Love Serenade'** was to your liking? If not, I can always treat you to a **'Dark Solo'**. I guarantee you’ll be falling for me in no time."

"No, no! I’m good!" I stammered, desperation rising. "Who... who are you?"

"Ah, how rude of me. I forgot to introduce myself. I am **MetalEtemon**, member of the **Pervert Guild** and its most refined gentleman. And might I ask the name of my lovely lady?"

"Just call me Sakura," I managed to say.

"Sakura?" He stroked his chin, pondering the name. "Elegant yet common, common yet elegant. A fine name!"

He snapped his fingers and started toward me. I barked at him to stop. "Don't come any closer! Or I'll—I'll—!"

I wanted to say 'call for help,' but the forest was suffocatingly dense. No one would hear me. I bit back the threat and tried to use my wits instead. "Could you... could you maybe sing something a bit softer? We girls don't really like all that shouting."

He seemed to consider this, turning away for a moment of reflection. I seized the chance, scrambled to my feet, and—dignity be damned—dove into a hollow tree, crawled out the other side, and bolted.
