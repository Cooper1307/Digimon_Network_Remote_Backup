The transition left me disoriented.

Once the ground felt solid beneath my feet, I surveyed my surroundings. Despite its name, Midgard was essentially an endless plaza. At its center stood a towering data wall—a network firewall designed to separate the external network of the Digital World from the hub.

"Up for an adventure, beautiful?"

A man with a thick Kansai accent brushed past me. I ignored him, silently stepping aside to give him room. I watched his form as he breached the data wall. At first, a chaotic swirl of data enveloped him, which he gradually absorbed until it became a part of his very being. When a golden ring of data surged upward through his frame, he was transformed in an instant into a Leomon.

Steeling my resolve, I followed his lead. I moved toward the data wall, tentatively nudging my body through the barrier.

The change was immediate. My hair shortened, thinning into strands of vibrant green, while a massive pink blossom erupted from my back. The air was suddenly thick with the scent of lilacs, and a strange weightlessness took hold of me. But then, as a radiant circuit of code ascended from my feet, I felt a searing heat ignite within. My limbs locked, immovable, as a kaleidoscope of data symbols collided and overlapped before my eyes.

"AAAAAAAUUUUGHHHH!"

The sensation was intolerable. I screamed—a raw, visceral sound. It felt as though ten thousand hands were wielding ten thousand razors, flaying the very skin from my body. The only constant was my heart, radiating a defiant heat from the inside out.

"What... what is happening?"

By the time I realized my body was warping, it was already too late. Every process, authorized or otherwise, was executing simultaneously. My stature shot upward; my limbs grew long and slender; my waist narrowed as my curves filled out. Two thick brambles erupted from my core, winding tightly around my torso and arms. The thorns dug in, constricting my chest until even breathing became a struggle.

**Lilamon, Mega Digivolutions—to Rosemon!**

The sudden, inexplicable evolution left me reeling. I stood frozen in place, my mind struggling to process the transition.

"Beautiful, get out of the way!"

A booming voice rang out behind me. I stammered an apology and scrambled to clear the path. "I'm sorry! This is my first time... I'm still adjusting..."

Before me stood a **MirageGaogamon**. Unlike the standard variety, he wore a cape emblazoned with the South Korean flag. Judging by his gear, he was undoubtedly a representative of the Korean Raiders.

"Fixed-point transport system initiated. Old coordinates discarded. New coordinates confirmed. Transfer beginning in ten... nine... eight..."

I watched as he vanished into a specialized transport stream. Once I was sure no one was watching, the embarrassment began to fade, replaced by a growing sense of awe. I found a patch of ice on the ground and peered at my reflection.

I was beyond satisfied. I had transformed from a cute girl into a literal goddess. I stood there, mesmerized by my own reflection, unable to pull myself away.
