"Oh—oh-oh-oh-oh!"

He was swinging through the trees on vines, closing the gap in seconds. I didn't dare look back.

"Running is~ use~ less~!"

Running was all I had. I would rather die than fall into the hands of a freak like him. But my luck ran out. My heel caught on a root, and I went sprawling. As he climbed down from a tree, cursing under his breath, he lunged forward, grabbed my ankle, and hoisted me into the air, dangling me upside down.

"Good girls shouldn't lie."

I aimed my free leg at his face and kicked with everything I had. It was like kicking a stone wall; he didn't even budge. He sighed, shook his head, and then—to my horror—turned his backside toward me and unleashed a **'Poop Gas'** attack. The stench was nearly fatal. Had I not been a Mega-level plant Digimon with natural air-purifying properties, I would have passed out on the spot.

"Feeling refreshed, are we?"

I didn't answer. I lashed out with the **'Thorn Whip'** wrapped around my arm, striking him across the rear. Instead of pain, he seemed to enjoy it, thrusting his backside out further and demanding I hit harder.

"You really are a pervert!"

"I’ll take that as a compliment!"

I was lost in a world I didn't understand. Even with Rosemon’s body, I had no idea how to use my skills, leaving me at the mercy of this monster. I struggled, but his patience was wearing thin.

"Little darling~" He crooned, a nickname that made my skin crawl. "I’ve been letting you have your fun, but you kept trying to play me for a fool. Now... it’s my turn to get angry."

He unleashed his **'World's Strongest Punch'** straight into my solar plexus.

Consciousness fled. I was sent flying like a discarded doll, bouncing between trunks and roots before crashing into a shallow pit. He wasn't finished. He stood over my broken form, urinated on me, and then leapt high for a **'Full Metal Hip Attack'**. The impact crushed my waist, pinning me into the dirt.

"Ah, no movement. It’s over then. Time to bring you back for the boys to play with for a few days..."

He chuckled, his fingers tightening around my throat as he hoisted me off the ground once more. He leaned in, his tongue flicking out for a disgusting lick against my cheek. But before he could savor it, the distant roar of an explosion made him shiver in fright.

"What was that!?" He freed one hand to scratch his head, muttering to himself. "We agreed to split up, bag the prey, and rendezvous. Why the explosions? Is this some new kink the guys are working on? I really can’t keep up with them."

Then, as if struck by a terrifying thought, his expression hardened into one of cold calculation. He began to study me—his "prey"—with renewed scrutiny. "Wait... did the objective change? It shouldn't have, unless something happened to the main force. Hmm... the Raiders *have* been awfully active lately. It’s not impossible we’ve run into them. Tsk. Such a shame to waste a flower like this... What are you exactly? A giant rose? Ah, right. That’s it. Bye-bye, beautiful. I’ve got to find my partners. If I can't have you, no one will!"

The intent was clear: he was going to destroy me.

He bared his teeth, his chest swelling with a renewed, manic fighting spirit. One hand remained clamped like a vise around my throat while the other reached toward the heavens. He roared the name of his finishing move:

**"Giga Blaster: Deadly Ray!"**

A surge of thick, black lightning cascaded from the heavens, engulfing my entire frame and pinning me in place. The pressure soon pierced my skin, shattering the **Trial Badge** mounted beneath my collarbone. My body began to digitize. In that moment, the pain vanished, replaced only by a strange, hollow sense of relief—the same peace I saw on my mother’s face during her final rites.

Beside me, the pervert known as Yamao Oochiku wore a grotesque smile, a mix of sadistic joy and mock-regret. His dark sunglasses hid his eyes, but for a split second, I wondered if he would look different without them. Perhaps he wouldn't look so much like a monster—even if that’s exactly what he was.

Seconds? Minutes? I couldn't tell. Then, a black disc whistled out of the forest shadows. It sliced through the lightning descending from above, richocheted off a tree trunk, and struck the hand crushing my throat. The pain made him howl, and his grip finally failed.

"AAAAAAGHHH! What the hell was that!? That hurts!"

I focused my eyes. It was a pitch-black **Brave Shield**. My heart skipped a beat. If the rumors were true, its owner was a **BlackWarGreymon**. But this shield was different—it bore the unmistakable engraving of the **Crest of Courage**.

"Hahaha!" MetalEtemon barked, clutching his forehead as he laughed. "Trying that old trick on me? Don't you know I'm the King of Digimon, forged from **Chrome Digizoid**? There’s a limit to how much a sneak attack can do!"

Before he could finish his boast, a black cyclone erupted from the depths of the forest, striking like a massive drill and sending the monkey spiraling into the air. He had expected to land gracefully, to strike a pose that proved his absolute toughness. But reality hit him harder. He fell like a stone, and as he hit the ground, I saw it: a gaping, jagged hole torn clean through his "indestructible" metal body.

"How... how is possible...? This is Chrome Digizoid... it shouldn't... be so easily..."

"I'm made of it too," a cold voice replied.

With his Digicore shattered, the silver ape dissolved into a cloud of data dust, carried away by the wind.

The owner of the shield retrieved his weapon, locking it back into place on his back. His dark silhouette flickered within the shadows of the trees, the **Dramon Killers** mounted on his arms glinting with a cold, metallic light. Everything about him screamed that he was the hero who had saved me from that nightmare.

He approached me, disarming his weapons and kneeling on one knee, like a knight coming to his queen's rescue.

"Are you okay?" he asked.

"Not really..." I managed to breathe. "Who are you?"

"BlackWarGreymon. No need for thanks."

"Ah... thank you for that... but I meant your name."

He paused for two seconds, contemplating the question.

"**Owl**," he replied. "And you?"

"Just call me Sakura."

"Don't move," he said, his tone turning serious. "You're badly hurt. I must take you back for treatment immediately."

"Back... back?" I asked, my voice growing fainter as my strength ebbed away. "Where... where are we going?"

At the question, he seemed to falter for a second before quickly adding, "Don't worry about that. It’s a good place. That is... if you trust me."

He was being foolish. Why wouldn't a fallen queen trust the very knight who had come to her rescue?

"Okay," I whispered with a weary nod. "Then I'll leave it to you."
