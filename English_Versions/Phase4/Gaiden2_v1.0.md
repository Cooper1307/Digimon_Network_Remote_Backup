# Gaiden 2: Abnormal Party Crusade

## (I)

### -By Red-

I am Red. My real name is Red; I despise fictional names.

In the Atrium system, every guild has its own elite frontrunners. Their strength isn't necessarily the highest, but the roles they play are certainly the most vital, second only to the guild's Chairman. In the **Holy Knights**, this position is occupied by us, the "**Red and Blue**" duo. The other guy is Blue—don't worry, he'll show up in the next part to say hello.

Some people think our personalities are mismatched. I don't blame them; you can see it just from our names. Furthermore, I am the Regional Operations Director for Coca-Cola, while he is the Regional Operations Manager for the competitor, Pepsi. I won't disclose exactly which regions. If someone said we were as close as brothers during our daily lives, almost no one would believe them.

The relationship we present to others is that of partners, friends, rivals, and market competitors. Thus, the missions we receive are also bound together, as the Chairman says it's "safer" that way. As if I didn't know—he actually does it to save on paying a second person for a job that requires two. If we couldn't even figure that out, we might as well quit being regional operations directors and go back to drinking a bottle of Coke.

That day, I had just reached my office, and my seat wasn't even warm yet, when I received a barrage of frantic messages from the Guild Chairman. One after another, the content of each message was basically the same: urging me to log on and take a job.

I asked him, "Don't you have anything else to do all day? Don't you need a life?"

He answered me point-blank, "What could a fishing enthusiast have to do? Every day I set up my rod and log on. My wife watches it for me, and when I come back, I even get to eat grilled fish..."

If you're going to talk, talk. Why suddenly brag in the middle of it? What's so great about having a wife?

I frowned and told him, "Tell me what it's about first. I'll see if I can make some time to evaporate from the human world for a bit."

"You know about the **Abnormal Party**, right?"

"What party?"

I was sure I hadn't misheard.

"Abnormal. You didn't mishear—abnormal. As the name suggests, it's a club formed by 'abnormals.' The club leader is a well-known 'Lust' female rogue, an alluring tramp. She loves taking her group of 'abnormals' into the Digital World to harass anyone with a decent appearance, acting as stalkers and flashers. Their targets are always people with a hint of sexiness. Apparently, they've been making quite a stir lately, and the higher-ups told me to send someone to clean them up. So I found you. No problem, right?"

Of course there was a problem.

I wasn't polite with him either and asked directly, "Where do you get the confidence that our 'Red and Blue' duo can handle this?"

"Well, you are the guild's representatives. If not you, then who else?"

"Why don't you go yourself?"

He laughed a few times and stated calmly, "If I go, who's going to manage the guild's affairs? Think about it—I even offloaded a mission to transport Belphemon to another guild. Do you think I'd have time to deal with a third-rate club? Wake up; I'm not that free."

So that Belphemon matter was his doing.

I knew it. How could a sleeping Demon Lord-type Digimon appear in the **Nature Court**'s territory for no reason? Someone definitely offloaded it on purpose. Passing the troubles assigned from above to others—that's his usual style. I'd long since ceased to be surprised by it.

"How long will this take, roughly?"

"For you two, I estimate no more than two days (two minutes). By the way, I've already notified Blue. He'll be waiting for you at the rendezvous point. I'll send you the specific coordinates later. I wish you a swift resolution and a triumphant return. That is all."

The messages from his end stopped. I hadn't even said I was free. Dammit, played again. Now I'd have to find a chance to take my equipment to the restroom.

I made sure the restroom door was locked from the inside and clicked on the left to successfully log in.

After passing through the Atrium public area and reaching the fire-wall, I looked up and saw a **Garudamon** returning from outside. Passing through the fire-wall, it turned into an old acquaintance of mine. His name is **Heath**, my drinking buddy and the president of the **Birdramon Commune**. He spends all day leading a bunch of **Birdramon** on patrols in the Digital World. He rescues people in distress and helps Digimon in danger. In short, he carries out the concept of "chivalry" to the end, and he has the best reputation in the entire Atrium system.

"Yo, look who it is—the daring truant Red."

He walked over and high-fived me, then gave my rear a smack. "Next time, you're buying the drinks. Pay back the money you owe me from last time! The boss recently hired a new bartender; I want the most expensive one!"

"Whatever you want, but I'm only ordering one glass."

Equal to a 330ml volume, a single glass of the cheapest wine in the entire bar costs more than twenty-three cans of Coca-Cola. It's hard not to admit that Chairman Adam is a shark.

After parting ways with him, I rushed to the designated location to meet up with Blue. When I arrived, I found he had already taken the form of **UlforceV-dramon** and charged alone into the **Abnormal Party**'s venue (stronghold), enjoying himself thoroughly. Specifically, he was sweeping up all the **Etemon** who were in a state of revelry. He drew the **Ulforce Saber** from his V-Bracelets to send the **Kinkakumon** and **Ginkakumon** who dared to block him away with one stroke, while also using **Shining V-Force** to take out a portion of the **WaruMonzaemon** he had knocked out earlier.

"—**Final Elysion**!"

I helped him clean up a portion of the **Gryzmon** who were planning to escape, as well as a group of **Gerbemon** who were attempting to fire **Poop Bazookas** at him.

"You're late."

The moment we met, he displayed such an attitude, as if I owed him something.

I told him helplessly, "I have to control the time I spend in the restroom so a cleaner doesn't find the stall empty but still locked from the inside and think it's haunted."

"Do you usually squat or sit?"

"Don't talk nonsense; toilets were invented to be sat on... You squat?"

"Yeah. My legs get numb if I squat too long."

"Ha, same if you sit too long."

The topic suddenly took a strange turn, but fortunately, we both realized it at the same time.

Following the dilapidated castle all the way deep inside, we encountered **Devidramon**—killed them. We met **Phantomon**—killed them. We met **Nanimon**—still killed them. You ask why there are no details? I'll tell you: a **Vanguard** doesn't need a process, only a result. Because the process lasts only a split second—too fast to describe in words.

Along the way, we saw many people who had been kidnapped by these abnormals and brought here. There were men and women, all given new appearances. Seeing "suggestive" outfits on Digimon felt more than a little jarring.

He reminded me, "Focus. Don't let your eyes wander."

I was speechless. "Didn't you look too? And so closely... Hey, I'm talking to you, give me a response."

See? This guy is narrow-minded and extremely hypocritical. Let me give a simple example: when going to the cinema to watch a movie, you usually buy popcorn and a drink at the counter. The price is usually a bit higher than what's sold outside. If the drink he buys is under the Coca-Cola company, he'll be miserable all day. Conversely, if it's from Pepsi, he thinks it's worth it no matter how expensive. So I feel like sometimes he just targets me on purpose—no reason, no purpose, just to vent, for the thrill of it.

Coming to a fork in the path further ahead, it split into two directions: one going up, leading directly to the castle's rooftop, and one going down, leading to the castle's dungeon. He had wings, so he naturally went up. I couldn't fly, so I automatically went down. Throughout the entire process, there was no verbal exchange—that's what you call a silent understanding.

The pitch-black underground space was vast and slippery, so I slowed down my pace. Soon, I discovered a figure hiding in the darkness—he wore a crown on his head and wrapped his body in a cape. He appeared to be a **KingEtemon**. Something was glowing behind his cape, flashing rhythmically, and he was humming a strange melody as if preparing something. Every now and then, he would chuckle to himself, letting out a few sinister laughs that made one's spine tingle.

I asked him, "What are you alone in there laughing about?"

"Hee hee hee," he chuckled. "Preparing a meeting gift for you."

With that, he suddenly threw open his cape, and subsequently, the entire underground illuminated with colored lights he had pre-arranged. The scene was entirely like a party venue; he was the host, and I was the only guest.

"Let us welcome today's VIP with a warm round of applause: Dukemon—!"

He showed off the character for "Great King" on his chest. Accompanied by music that sounded like noise, the atmosphere failed to heat up at all, perhaps due to my cold indifference. Affected by this, he became less calm, gritting his teeth in frustration and casually sending out a gift tailored for me—his ultimate move.

"—**Photon Blocker**!"

The glowing sphere hit my shield, and absolutely nothing happened. The scene instantly became very awkward.

At this, I huffed coldly and said, "Is that it?"

He then extended a finger and wagged it in front of my eyes. "NO, NO, NO. This is just the foreplay. The good stuff is yet to come. For example... hee hee... see the environment here? There's a breach!—**King Monkey Kick**!"

Taking a step to the left and holding up my shield, I smoothly and easily avoided it.

"Ah... this..."

Dammit, how did I let him speak first this time? This shouldn't be happening.

In front of him, I offered my mockery, asking, "Don't you have that kind of extremely powerful skill that can stir up a person's tension and make them deal with you seriously?"

He pretended to think for a moment and then answered, "I do. For example, now..."

He bared his teeth at me, and still, absolutely nothing happened. Never mind him; even I felt embarrassed for him. If there were a crack in the ground right now, I guarantee the first one to dive into it wouldn't be him, but me.

What a joke.

"Ah, I've had enough!" I, the competent audience member, couldn't help but complain. "You waste, '**performing a monkey show**' is for you to play others, not for you to act as the monkey yourself and play with yourself. Go to hell!"

Thrusting out the lance in my right hand, I initiated **Royal Saber**. He stood there, not even dodging, and obediently let me pierce his chest. He turned into a mass of data residue and vanished forever from this world.

So, what exactly was I expecting?

### -By Blue-

I am Blue. I'm direct.
The Boss (He) wants me to crusade against the **Abnormal Party**. I'll go.

[ YES ]

I walked into the company's data server room, swiped my card to enter, turned around to close the door, and made sure it was locked from the inside. I took the equipment out of my backpack and plugged it in, then clicked the button on the left to login to the Atrium system.

Passing through the fire-wall and arriving at the rendezvous point, I imagined myself as a wooden post, standing in front of the castle gate for nearly two hours. The red guy never showed up. During that time, three groups of people entered the castle, each with a bountiful harvest. The prey they caught were all humanoid living Digimon, with a balanced ratio of males and females, all with quite good figures.

At first, I was even thinking: *don't these guys get tired of eating this stuff all day?* Then a **Nanomon** came over to pick a fight with me: "Hey, you! Who are you!? Private property, no trespassing!"

"I'm waiting for someone."

"Waiting? For who? Do I know them?"

"Probably not," I answered honestly. "He should be here any second. When you see him, you'll know if you recognize him."

Later, he harassed me for a while, insisting I leave. He didn't think about how that could be possible—the mission wasn't finished, the other teammate hadn't arrived, and he wanted me to go away? No way.

"I see you're refusing a toast only to drink a forfeit..."

I found him annoying, so I drew the sword from my bracelet and gave a light swing. He was cut into two pieces and vanished with the wind as ash.

"Whew, finally some peace and quiet."

Hardly had I spoken when someone happened to come out of the castle and witnessed this scene, standing there stunned. I turned my head and looked carefully; it was an **Insekimon**.

Seeing his resemblance to **Gotsumon**, I called out to him and asked, "What's your relation to Gotsumon?"

"I don't know!" He shuddered, then turned back, pushed open the castle gate, and ran inside at full speed, screaming as he went: "Nanomon is dead! Someone come quick—someone's looking for trouble at the door!"

Afterward, a group of **Myotismon** and **Volcamon** burst out of the castle, one by one looking aggressive, saying they were going to skin me and smash my armor to avenge their comrades. I was deeply moved by the camaraderie they displayed, so I held back a bit and didn't use my best speed. Yet they still died—it was quite ridiculous.

"What's going on?" I was puzzled on the spot. "Why is everyone targeting me today? Looks like I'll have to let that guy share some of the burden later. Good, it's decided."

After a while, the Guild Boss connected with me and asked, "Blue, I just caught a glimpse of your location. What are you doing standing in front of that castle gate alone?"

"Waiting for Red."

"You're in the wrong place."

"The location you gave me is here; it's correct."

"Yes, the location is there, but—that's the enemy's stronghold."

Holy crap! I knew there was a reason they were all targeting me—it turned out I had exposed myself. My bad, my bad.

In case he couldn't find me later, I asked the Boss about the situation: "Why hasn't Red arrived yet?"

"I just got in touch with him. He should be there any second. Wait a bit longer."

"No," I told him. "I have things to do."

"What things?"

"Purging."

With that, I raised the light sword in my hand, sliced open the castle gate, and drifted inside, starting an indiscriminate massacre of the inhabitants.

No one was innocent. No one could leave alive to tell this tale—especially not to Red. No one. As for the Boss, he's the type to forget once he's said it, and besides, it's not a big matter; he won't take it to heart. So there was no need to worry—it's never too late to kill after speaking out.

Then, what happened in the previous part occurred. Red went to the dungeon, and I went to the rooftop.

The path to the rooftop was clear. Arriving at a bell tower, a **Piemon** suddenly hopped out, balancing on a ball and moving nimbly, showing off his exquisite balance.

"Do you want to die?" I asked him.

"I don't," he answered unhurriedly.

"Then get off that thing. Stop dancing around in front of me."

Saying this, I kicked his ball away. He made a powerful leap, flipping over my head and casually throwing down a white cloth, just big enough to cover my body.

He naively thought I would do nothing, just stand there and let the cloth cover me, then turn into a keychain hanging at his waist. Of course I wouldn't let him succeed, and it was hard for him anyway, because I had already activated **Ulforce**. That cloth's falling speed in my eyes was comparable to a snail on the ground—the time was ridiculously long. I even had time to pinch the four corners and re-fold it into a new shape, then place it under his feet as a stepping stone before he landed. Afterward, I ran back to my original spot, making him think I had been stationary all along.

"You—"

Seeing that I hadn't disappeared and that the cloth, now folded into a flower shape, was under his feet, the look on his contorted face was beyond hilarious.

"The clown is always the one being played," I told him. "If you want to cry, just cry. I'll wipe your tears for you."

"Aaaarrgh—!"

He was furious. He drew the four swords from his back and threw them at me.

"—**Trump Sword**!"

Similarly, the speed of the four swords was very slow—slow enough that his juggling couldn't be fully utilized. He originally wanted to make it impossible for me to find the correct direction they were coming from, but to me, their disappearance was just them turning transparent.

If I were to expose his trick to his face, he might cry himself to death, so I made preparations in advance. I kindly picked up that cloth from earlier, wiped all four swords clean, and then tied the four corners of the cloth to the hilts of the four swords. I moved the whole assembly directly above his head, allowing it to drop. As it fell, I raised the sword in my hand, sliced through his waist, and sent him on his final journey.

After resolving it, Red rushed up from below to meet me. He told me it was strange—KingEtemon had done absolutely nothing and just stood there frozen. He had just charged in with his lance and finished the guy.

I thought about it and asked him, "Don't you know there's something called network latency?"

"I know, but dammit, that was too slow!"

"It's not that he was slow; it's that our network is too good."

"Fair enough."

"Pepsi's network department has always been reliable."

"Our Coke's isn't bad either."

Then we both put on a face that said we wanted to kill each other, but aimed our weapons behind us. There was a bitch trying to sneak attack us from behind, but unfortunately, we had noticed her long ago.

"Just like the intelligence said," Red raised his voice on purpose. "The club leader of the **Abnormal Party**, **Lilithmon**, an alluring tramp."

"Hahaha," she let out a laugh at both of us like a maniac. "Calling me alluring, hmm... I admit it. After all, a person is beautiful like this all their life. Calling me a tramp, hmm... you're the tramp! Your whole family are tramps!"

Her sudden change of face caught us off guard.

Red sighed and leaned in close to me without an expression, asking, "We both just got insulted by a tramp. I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now. What do you say?"

What else could be done? The old way.

"As if I'm comfortable," I told Red. "Say no more. Beat her."

We agreed instantly, but the next second, the opponent immediately chickened out.

"Wait, you... don't come over yet!"

Too late. My fist had already swung out and had already touched her face. Her feet were off the ground, and she'd likely fall from the rooftop platform to the ground in a few seconds. If she was lucky, her face wouldn't be ruined.

"What are you in such a hurry for?" Red asked me helplessly. "The new drink reception at the **Drink a Cup Bar** doesn't start for another seven hours. Going now, you won't even get a seat. Just give up."

What? The new drink reception is today? How could I be so uninformed?

"The old rule," he suggested. "Whoever takes her down last doesn't pay tonight; the other one treats."

"Then I'd better hurry."

"Don't worry, I haven't called start yet. Three, two, one... Start!"

What's the difference? I'm already ahead!

"DO—NOT—ACTIVATE—ULFORCE—"

The time it took him to say those words was too long—long enough for me to vault over the castle wall first, spread my wings and fly down, reaching Lilithmon's side. First, I cut off her right **Nazar Nail** that could corrode anything, then I tied her wings in a knot, helped her tidy her messy hair, and finally moved her over the nearby lake, waiting for her to fall into the water.

After waiting by the lake for a while, I finally saw Red.

"Yo, you're here."

"Why did you run so fast?" he said, panting. "Where is she?"

I turned my head and glanced at the bubbling lake surface. "Bathing. No peeking."

"And yet you're looking?"

"I have a taste for it."

"No way," his eyes widened. "You like her type?"

I nodded and told him, "Everyone has their hobbies."

"Eww... hobbies. I'd say 'abnormal' is more like it."

"An abnormal resolving an abnormal—I'd say it's just right."

"Fair enough." He leaned against a tree and asked me, "When do you plan to save her?"

"Not saving her."

"Why? Didn't you just say you like her? Turning your back so soon?"

"Not that." I answered him. "I just accidentally let my 'abnormal' side out. I wanted to see if a Digimon can drown in water. Look, she's still struggling, but she's almost..."

The words had hardly left my mouth when suddenly, an **Ouryumon** burst out of the lake, swallowed her whole, and then dived back to the bottom with satisfaction. Before leaving, it even turned toward us and let out a burp like a clap of thunder, thanking us for the feeding.

"This—"

"This... is it over?"

We said it in unison. Neither of us gave the other a reply; we just stood there, staring at the lake surface, hoping to see a flower bloom or something. After a while, Red broke the silence:

"I don't know why, but I suddenly feel like drinking."

I cast a vote of approval. "Old place, old specifications?"

"Let's go!"

We agreed once more and turned toward the **Drink a Cup Bar**. After greeting Red's old friend Heath and exchanging a few words, we learned there were no seats left. We had to find two empty barrels from the warehouse in the back to sit on.

"What'll the two **Vanguards** have today?"

The boss greeted us warmly and recommended we try the new style mixed by the new bartender. For no other reason than that the drink mixed by the newcomer wasn't very expensive, and I'd been drinking the old specification for a long time anyway—it was time for a change of flavor.

"Here it is: the latest style, the 'Super Big Crayon'. Remember to stir it before drinking for a better taste. Enjoy."

It was a relatively expensive drink, with a slightly deep color—between brown and orange-red. It looked like coffee but wasn't coffee; it was bubbling inside, and the taste was very familiar.

"Don't you think..."

"Yeah, I have the same feeling."

A silent understanding is what builds rapport.

I asked the boss, "Excuse me, what are the ingredients for this drink?"

He answered with a single word that instantly unsettled us both.

"Cola."

"WHAT BRAND!?"

We both asked this question very loudly, making the noisy bar go silent for two or three seconds before it resumed its normalcy. Adding a few laughs to the rowdy crowd was exactly what we should do.

"You guys... seriously."

The boss leaned in with a look like he was concerned for idiots and told us grumpily, "Dr. Pepper. What, you have a problem?"

No problem. Just felt a bit of a pity. We both felt that way. Between "Red and Blue," there was never a need for verbal communication; everything was understood without words.
