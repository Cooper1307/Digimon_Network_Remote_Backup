# MTPE Bible: Chapter 2 - Part 2: The Still Water (明镜止水) v1.0

## Module A: Paragraph Analysis & Logic

### [A.1] The Ghost of Sparrow

**Source:** 是一个叫雀（Sparrow）的天女兽... 让妖女兽的鹤进化成了莫斯提兽（MASTEMON）。
**Analysis:** Introduction of the backstory for Crane and the deceased Sparrow. Sparrow's death and the subsequent evolution into Mastemon (a Digimon born from the fusion of Light and Dark) is a central emotional anchor for the "Free Birds" group.
**Terminology Notes:** **Mastemon** (莫斯提兽) is the official localization. The fusion of **Angewomon** (Sparrow) and **LadyDevimon** (Crane) logic is preserved.

### [A.2] The Queen's Provocation

**Source:** “吃了老娘豆腐还想走，占便宜也不看看主人是谁！”
**Analysis:** Queen (TigerVespamon) represents the aggressive, self-governing nature of the The 'Drink' Bar. Her dialect and rough mannerisms are translated to reflect a "tough, street-smart leader" archetype.
**Tone Sync:** "Eating tofu" is a localized idiom for sexual harassment/groping. Translated as "Thinking you can cop a feel and just walk away? You clearly don't know whose turf you're on!" to maintain the gravity and mature tone.

```

## Module C: Translation Principles (Combat Focus)

- **Principle: Sound-to-Impact Mapping.** In the duel between Owl (BlackWarGreymon) and Queen (TigerVespamon), use onomatopoeia and sharp verbs to simulate the "clash of alloy."
- **Example:** "The Brave Shield slammed into her waist with a dull thud, the vibration rippling through the air."
