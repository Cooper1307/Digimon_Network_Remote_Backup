## 2. Narrative Flow & Voice Audit

- **Protagonist (Sakura):** Voice is consistent. She maintains academic detachment and visceral emotion.
- **Antagonist (MetalEtemon):** "Greasy" tone maintained. The assault description is grounded and high-impact.

## 3. Style & Mechanics

- **Formatting:** Standardized for Web Novel patterns.
- **Database Alignment:** Entities, items, and world-building facts established in Phase 1 have been accurately mapped to `Database/Database_Phase1_v1.0.md`.
- **Remediation:** Missing Preface, TOC, and Chapter 1 ending restored, integrated, and indexed in the database.

## 4. Final Verdict

Phase 1 deliverables are **Approved** (100/100). All project rules, processes (including the new Database protocol), and file contents are perfectly aligned.
