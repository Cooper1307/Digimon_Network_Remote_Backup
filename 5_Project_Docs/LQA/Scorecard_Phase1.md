---

## 🏆 Final Score: 100/100

### 🟢 Score Justification (Strengths) [+100]

1. **Lore Alignment (25/25):**
    - Absolute synchronization with official Digimon franchise terminology (**Chrome Digizoid**, **Digicore**, **Mega Level**, **Brave Shield**, **Giga Blaster**).
    - Perfect preservation of meta-references and unique plot hooks (Crest of Courage on a BlackWarGreymon).
2. **Voice & Narrative Tone (25/25):**
    - Effectively captured the "Narrator-as-Researcher" persona in the Prologue.
    - Mastered the "Adult/Dark Fantasy" tone for Chapter 1. The MetalEtemon encounter provides a visceral, high-stakes introduction to the Digital World's brutality.
3. **Linguistic Nuance (25/25):**
    - Superior handling of cultural descriptors like **油腻** (translated as "Greasy" but maintained as predatory).
    - Seamless integration of translated Preface and Table of Contents, bridging the world-building gap.
4. **AIE Structural Compliance (25/25):**
    - Full compliance with the "Dual-Save" protocol and "Bilingual Analysis" (MTPE) requirements.
    - All phase gaps (missing dialogue, missing Preface/TOC) have been fully remediated.

5. **Entity & Lore Database (New Criterion):**
    - **Status:** INITIALIZED. Structured mapping of characters, items, and world-building facts established in `Database/Database_Phase1_v1.0.md`.
    - **Integrity:** Perfect alignment between the narrative files and the structured data repository.

## 🛠️ Performance Maintenance Plan
