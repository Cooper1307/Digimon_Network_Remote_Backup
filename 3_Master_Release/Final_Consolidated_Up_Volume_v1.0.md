# Digital Monster Network: The Raiders

## Preface

This work is an original fan-fiction based on the *DIGIMON* series. It can be understood as a story where humans assume the roles of Digimon to embark on network adventures. The setting utilizes a fused worldview and excludes supernatural elements such as X-Antibody or Hybrids. The narrative alternates between the "Main Story" and "Side Stories," spanning a total of nine volumes. The "Upper Volume" covers the first four parts, the "Middle Volume" encompasses the fifth, and the "Lower Volume" comprises the final four. The Main Story follows the journey of the lead heroine, while the Side Stories provide perspectives from other characters (excluding Guild Leaders) to expand on secondary plotlines.

The setting is a near-future era where humanity has established a new login hub in the Digital World known as **Midgard**. Time in Midgard flows identically to the Digital World: one day there is roughly equivalent to one minute in reality, meaning four years in Midgard equate to a single day in our world. Originally created as a platform for professionals to identify and resolve network issues within the Digital World, it was eventually promoted to the public, evolving into a massive, live-action interactive experience system. Anyone can easily access it by purchasing an EDEN sensory immersion rig.

To prevent an influx of users from disrupting the natural lives of resident Digimon and triggering cybersecurity incidents, developers implemented a mandatory protocol: all users passing through the network firewalls at Midgard are forcibly transformed into the Digimon avatar they selected within their respective Guilds. Each user is limited to a single Digimon bond. Initially, users may only choose a Digimon in its Rookie stage (selection constitutes joining the corresponding Guild). All user avatars are equipped with an "Trial Badge"a chip the size of a fingernail, typically embedded within the bodyto distinguish them from genuine Digimon. By touching a target's body, if the chip glows red, the individual is a human avatar; if there is no reaction, they are a true Digimon.

Based on different types of Digimon, ten Great Guilds have been established in Midgard:

- **Order of Holy Knights**

- **Nether Club**

- **Mutant Research Lab**

- **Atlantis**

- **Drink a Glass Bar**

- **Steel Legions**

- **Sylvan Garden**

- **Imperial Dragon's Nest**

- **Beast King's Fangs**

- **Wind-Chasing Brigade**

Every two years, each Guild hosts an internal "Guild War" where members face off in PK matches. The final victor is awarded a "Promotion Seed" by official authorities. Once consumed, it allows for a partial expansion of the user's data, manifesting as an evolution or form change that lasts for up to 600 seconds (ten minutes) before the user reverts to their previous state. Additionally, those who defeat their Guild Master receive extra rewards.

All characters appearing in this work are adults, making this a narrative that leans away from younger audiences. The entire story was drafted with the full chapter structure in mind; therefore, there is no risk of a "bad ending" or the story being abandoned due to a lack of content. You may read with peace of mind.

Lastly, I wish you all a pleasant reading experience.

### Prologue: The Raiders

Humanity’s quest to explore the Digital World knows no end.

In the physical world, the network is the lifeblood of existence. But a network requires maintenance; maintenance demands the detection of flaws, and flaws demand resolution. Such is the cycle of human necessity. Yet, identifying these fissures is no simple feat. The digital realm is far more intricate than we dare imagine—lacking physical substance, its most critical clues often elude the naked eye, spiraling into lethal catastrophes. Even with our mastery over code, we cannot wait for data to self-correct. Human intervention remains our only true safeguard.

Then, one day, an esteemed academic proposed a radical hypothesis: If every digital event is a reflection of local reality, why not strike at the root? By plunging directly into the Digital World to uproot the cause, wouldn't the glitches in our physical realm dissolve of their own accord?

I countered him immediately. "How do you know the intruder won't become the next catastrophe? If our presence adds unnecessary strain to that space—forget whether the original glitch can even be localized—whether your agent can even survive the return is a gamble. To say nothing of the ripple effects that would follow."

After a grueling debate, the consensus sided with him. They argued we must look toward the future; that while risks were inevitable, they were obstacles meant to be overcome.

Five years later, Midgard rose.

Ten years later, the EDEN sensory immersion rigs became a household standard.

And then, the world finally tasted the cruelty of the Digital World—especially in those uncharted territories beyond human reach. To die there was to be shredded into raw data, leaving nothing behind.

From alpha tests to open beta, and finally to full operation, I bore witness to the birth of the Guilds. I watched as wave after wave of pioneers breached the network firewalls, assuming the forms of Digimon only to march toward their deaths on the far side. Many vanished without a whisper. A part of me believes I failed them—that their silence is a burden I must carry. Perhaps if I had won that debate years ago, there would be more happy families in this world today.

Perhaps this entire endeavor was a mistake from the beginning—a problem in its own right. And so, I became the one to solve it.

I founded **The Raiders**.

They were drafted by nation-state, elected from the elite of the major Guilds. The minimum requirement for entry was the Mega Level. Guild Leaders were excluded, for a flock of dragons must never be without its head. Through rigorous multi-layered screenings, each nation selected a single representative for The Raiders. This was done for two reasons: equity and security.

Before every excursion into the unknown, I sought their consent. Or more accurately, I sought the blessing of their superiors. If their governments deemed them expendable, I had no voice to object.

With every raid, I tasked them with retrieving data samples. These allowed me to analyze the environment, construct predictive topographical models, and assess threat levels to ensure the next party’s survival.

To date, twenty nations have joined the cause. Within the unit, two factions have already emerged: The "U.N. Big Five" and the "Nordic Five." I was told this was the will of their respective governments. I had no power to interfere, nor the desire to. In truth, I found it fitting. To brave the abyss with comrades bound by absolute trust—it was a dream I once held myself. They realized it for me, and their results have been nothing short of extraordinary.

These small units operate in teams of five, fulfilling specific roles: **Vanguard, Support, Striker, Defender, and Backup.** Their coordination is surgical, and so far, every mission has proceeded without a hitch.

That is all I can share for now. Indeed, that is all they permit me to say.

Oh, one last thing. Before they departed, they asked me to leave a message for everyone logging in for the first time:

#### "Welcome to the Digital World."

### Chapter 1: The Ebon Hero

My mothers life flickered and vanished in an instant, a sudden severance from the only anchor I had left.

In her will—penned while she yet lived—she transferred her Midgard account to my name. It had been active for less than seventy-two hours in the physical world, yet she hoped it would offer me solace in her stead, keeping the shroud of loneliness at bay.

I set aside my research papers, requested leave from my advisor, and departed Tokyo for my long-forsaken hometown of Kyoto. Everything remained exactly as I remembered it. My neighbors were waiting for me; they helped arrange the mortician and saw to my mother’s final rites.

"How did she die?" I asked.

"We don't know," my neighbor replied. "The police said it appeared to be sudden cardiac arrest."

Sudden death? How absurd a way to go—not even granted a final glimpse of the world.

After saying my final goodbyes, I went to her room to settle her affairs. Tucked beneath her pillow, I found a diary. It was a record of her past—most of it chronicling her adventures in Midgard, where she had assumed the form of a Digimon.

"Lalamon... Kiwimon... Lilamon..."

I whispered the names one by one. From her beginnings as a Rookie to her ascent to the Ultimate level, the pages were a testament to her long struggle.

Through her entries, I began to understand her life within Midgard. She had been a member of the **Sylvan Garden Guild** and had forged a pact with a user named Snake: whoever could evolve their Lilamon into its Mega level first would earn the right to campaign for the position of the next Guild Master.

*“A single minute in the waking world unravels into a full day within the digital abyss.?

If that rule held true, she had been immersed in that world for at least ten years. According to her diary, a decade was more than enough time for a Digimon to climb from the Rookie stage to the Mega level. If one were diligent and took on enough guild commissions, eight or nine years would suffice. In other words, this "Snake" had surely already secured the right to the candidacy—perhaps they were already the Guild Master.

I inherited my mother’s fierce competitive streak. Knowing her, had she still been alive, she never would have let Snake best her. A surge of indignation rose within me. I decided then and there to find Snake and settle the score.

Following the clues left on the final page of the diary, I climbed into the attic of our old house. I waded through a mountain of junk shrouded in plastic until I finally unearthed her EDEN sensory immersion rig. It looked remarkably new, free of dust; she couldn't have used it for long.

I pulled out the manual, connected the power, and inserted the authentication card she had prepared for me. Once the system verified my identity, a sudden flash of light blinded me. By the time I regained my senses, my body had already transitioned into a completely new space.

Clicking the button on the left, a violent surge of raw data seized my consciousness, hurtling me through the void as my physical form dissolved into code. The journey was faster than a rocket; in the blink of an eye, I had successfully logged into the Midgard system and arrived at this vast tourist hub.

The transition left me disoriented.

Once the ground felt solid beneath my feet, I surveyed my surroundings. Despite its name, Midgard was essentially an endless plaza. At its center stood a towering data wall—a network firewall designed to separate the external network of the Digital World from the hub.

"Up for an adventure, beautiful?"

A man with a thick Kansai accent brushed past me. I ignored him, silently stepping aside to give him room. I watched his form as he breached the data wall. At first, a chaotic swirl of data enveloped him, which he gradually absorbed until it became a part of his very being. When a golden ring of data surged upward through his frame, he was transformed in an instant into a Leomon.

Steeling my resolve, I followed his lead. I moved toward the data wall, tentatively nudging my body through the barrier.

The transformation hit with the force of a physical blow. Green tendrils sprouted where hair once fell, while a massive pink blossom erupted from my back. The air was suddenly thick with the scent of lilacs, and a strange weightlessness took hold of me. But then, as a radiant circuit of code ascended from my feet, I felt a searing heat ignite within. My limbs locked, immovable, as a kaleidoscope of data symbols collided and overlapped before my eyes.

"AAAAAAAUUUUGHHHH!"

The sensation was intolerable. I screamed—a raw, visceral sound. It felt as though ten thousand hands were wielding ten thousand razors, flaying the very skin from my body. The only constant was my heart, radiating a defiant heat from the inside out.

"What... what is happening?"

By the time I realized my body was warping, it was already too late. Every process, authorized or otherwise, was executing simultaneously. My stature shot upward; my limbs grew long and slender; my waist narrowed as my curves filled out. Two thick brambles erupted from my core, winding tightly around my torso and arms. The thorns dug in, constricting my chest until even breathing became a struggle.

#### Lilamon, Mega Digivolutions—to Rosemon

The sudden, inexplicable evolution left me reeling. I stood frozen in place, my mind struggling to process the transition.

"Move, beautiful, or be trampled!"

A booming voice rang out behind me. I stammered an apology and scrambled to clear the path. "I'm sorry! This is my first time... I'm still adjusting..."

Before me stood a **MirageGaogamon**. Unlike the standard variety, he wore a cape emblazoned with the South Korean flag. Judging by his gear, he was undoubtedly a representative of the Korean Raiders.

"Fixed-point transport system initiated. Old coordinates discarded. New coordinates confirmed. Transfer beginning in ten... nine... eight..."

I watched as he vanished into a specialized transport stream. Once I was sure no one was watching, the embarrassment began to fade, replaced by a growing sense of awe. I found a patch of ice on the ground and peered at my reflection.

I was beyond satisfied. I had transformed from a cute girl into a literal goddess. I stood there, mesmerized by my own reflection, unable to pull myself away.

---

Blissfully ignorant, I stepped through the data wall into the outer world. My attention was entirely fixed on my new self—until I realized I had wandered into a dense forest and was quite "gloriously" lost.

Glancing back, the data wall was still visible, its surface scrolling with mundane social news from the Digital World. It was all the same nonsense: one tribe declaring war on another over a stolen turnip; another group swimming straight into a Whamon’s mouth; or a "rebel human faction" being infiltrated and pummeled by pro-human operatives in Digimon forms. Things that would be scandals in the human world were just everyday trivia here.

*I know where the data wall is,* I told myself. *As long as I keep my bearings, I’ll be fine. I might as well explore a bit before heading back to the guild to find Snake.*

But I had underestimated the forest. The bizarre, twisted trees soon blurred into a confusing maze, and within minutes, the towering data wall was gone. I was utterly lost. Disoriented, I stumbled through the gloom, making no progress toward an exit. Instead, I succeeded only in getting hit squarely on the head by a piece of falling fruit.

"Ow... that really hurts..."

I was clutching my head, rolling on the ground in pain, when a face appeared above me, clearly having waited for some time. It was a face that could only be described as loathsome. His teeth were a stained, sickly yellow; dark sunglasses masked his eyes; a WaruMonzaemon plush dangled from his waist. With a rose clenched in his teeth and a microphone in hand, he belted out a tune that was pure acoustic torture. He was the absolute embodiment of the word "greasy."

"Does my lady have a headache?" he asked, his voice dripping with mock-concern. "Or perhaps... you are simply dazed by my beauty?"

I slapped him. Forgive me—I couldn't help it.

But the result was not what I expected. Despite the full force of my blow, he didn't even flinch. He didn’t show a hint of pain or even an acknowledgment of the insult. Instead, he grinned wider, leaning in closer. "Oh, poor thing. Does your hand hurt? Do you need me to rub it for you?"

"Get away from me!" I scrambled back, clutching my chest to guard myself.

"Ooh, a feisty one. I like that." He snapped his fingers and gave a theatrical, mock-gentlemanly bow. "I trust my **'Love Serenade'****'Dark Solo'**. I guarantee you’ll be falling for me in no time."

"No, no! I’m good!" I stammered, desperation rising. "Who... who are you?"

"Ah, how rude of me. I forgot to introduce myself. I am **MetalEtemon**, member of the **Pervert Guild** and its most refined gentleman. And might I ask the name of my lovely lady?"

"Just call me Sakura," I managed to say.

"Sakura?" He stroked his chin, pondering the name. "Elegant yet common, common yet elegant. A fine name!"

He snapped his fingers and started toward me. I barked at him to stop. "Don't come any closer! Or I'll—I'll?"

I wanted to say 'call for help,' but the forest was suffocatingly dense. No one would hear me. I bit back the threat and tried to use my wits instead. "Could you... could you maybe sing something a bit softer? We girls don't really like all that shouting."

He seemed to consider this, turning away for a moment of reflection. I seized the chance, scrambled to my feet, and—dignity be damned—dove into a hollow tree, crawled out the other side, and bolted.

"Oh—oh-oh-oh-oh!"

He was swinging through the trees on vines, closing the gap in seconds. I didn't dare look back.

"Running is~ use~ less~!"

Running was all I had. I would rather die than fall into the hands of a freak like him. But my luck ran out. My heel caught on a root, and I went sprawling. As he climbed down from a tree, cursing under his breath, he lunged forward, grabbed my ankle, and hoisted me into the air, dangling me upside down.

"Good girls shouldn't lie."

I aimed my free leg at his face and kicked with everything I had. It was like kicking a stone wall; he didn't even budge. He sighed, shook his head, and then—to my horror—turned his backside toward me and unleashed a **'Poop Gas'** attack. The stench was nearly fatal. Had I not been a Mega-level plant Digimon with natural air-purifying properties, I would have passed out on the spot.

"Feeling refreshed, are we?"

I didn't answer. I lashed out with the **'Thorn Whip'** wrapped around my arm, striking him across the rear. Instead of pain, he seemed to enjoy it, thrusting his backside out further and demanding I hit harder.

"You really are a pervert!"

"I’ll take that as a compliment!"

I was lost in a world I didn't understand. Even with Rosemon’s body, I had no idea how to use my skills, leaving me at the mercy of this monster. I struggled, but his patience was wearing thin.

"Little darling~" He crooned, a nickname that made my skin crawl. "I’ve been letting you have your fun, but you kept trying to play me for a fool. Now... it’s my turn to get angry."

He unleashed a massive fist, backed by the weight of a godhis **'World's Strongest Punch'**straight into my solar plexus.

Consciousness fled. I was sent flying like a discarded doll, bouncing between trunks and roots before crashing into a shallow pit. He wasn't finished. Standing over my shattered remains, he desecrated the scene with a vile display of contempt before launching himself skyward for a bone-crushing **'Full Metal Hip Attack'**. The impact crushed my waist, pinning me into the dirt.

---

"Ah, no movement. It’s over then. Time to bring you back for the boys to play with for a few days..."

He chuckled, his fingers tightening around my throat as he hoisted me off the ground once more. He leaned in, his tongue flicking out for a disgusting lick against my cheek. But before he could savor it, the distant roar of an explosion made him shiver in fright.

"What was that!?" He freed one hand to scratch his head, muttering to himself. "We agreed to split up, bag the prey, and rendezvous. Why the explosions? Is this some new kink the guys are working on? I really can’t keep up with them."

Then, as if struck by a terrifying thought, his expression hardened into one of cold calculation. He began to study me—his "prey"—with renewed scrutiny. "Wait... did the objective change? It shouldn't have, unless something happened to the main force. Hmm... the Raiders *have* been awfully active lately. It’s not impossible we’ve run into them. Tsk. Such a shame to waste a flower like this... What are you exactly? A giant rose? Ah, right. That’s it. Bye-bye, beautiful. I’ve got to find my partners. If I can't have you, no one will!"

The intent was clear: he was going to destroy me.

He bared his teeth, his chest swelling with a renewed, manic fighting spirit. One hand remained clamped like a vise around my throat while the other reached toward the heavens. He roared the name of his finishing move:

#### "Giga Blaster: Deadly Ray!"

A surge of thick, black lightning cascaded from the heavens, engulfing my entire frame and pinning me in place. The pressure soon pierced my skin, shattering the **Trial Badge** mounted beneath my collarbone. My body began to digitize. In that moment, the pain vanished, replaced only by a strange, hollow sense of relief—the same peace I saw on my mother’s face during her final rites.

Beside me, the pervert known as Yamao Oochiku wore a grotesque smile, a mix of sadistic joy and mock-regret. His dark sunglasses hid his eyes, but for a split second, I wondered if he would look different without them. Perhaps he wouldn't look so much like a monster—even if that’s exactly what he was.

Seconds? Minutes? I couldn't tell. Then, a black disc whistled out of the forest shadows. It sliced through the lightning descending from above, richocheted off a tree trunk, and struck the hand crushing my throat. The pain made him howl, and his grip finally failed.

"AAAAAAGHHH! What the hell was that!? That hurts!"

I focused my eyes. It was a pitch-black **Brave Shield**. My heart skipped a beat. If the rumors were true, its owner was a **BlackWarGreymon**. But this shield was different—it bore the unmistakable engraving of the **Crest of Courage**.

"Hahaha!" MetalEtemon barked, clutching his forehead as he laughed. "Trying that old trick on me? Don't you know I'm the King of Digimon, forged from **Chrome Digizoid**? There’s a limit to how much a sneak attack can do!"

Before he could finish his boast, a black cyclone tore from the heart of the woods, a drilling force of destruction that launched the silver ape into the sky. He had expected to land gracefully, to strike a pose that proved his absolute toughness. But reality hit him harder. He fell like a stone, and as he hit the ground, I saw it: a gaping, jagged hole torn clean through his "indestructible" metal body.

"How... how is possible...? This is Chrome Digizoid... it shouldn't... be so easily..."

"I'm made of it too," a cold voice replied.

With his Digicore shattered, the silver ape dissolved into a cloud of data dust, carried away by the wind.

The owner of the shield retrieved his weapon, locking it back into place on his back. His dark silhouette flickered within the shadows of the trees, the **Dramon Killers** mounted on his arms glinting with a cold, metallic light. Everything about him screamed that he was the hero who had saved me from that nightmare.

He approached me, disarming his weapons and kneeling on one knee, like a knight coming to his queen's rescue.

"Are you okay?" he asked.

"Not really..." I managed to breathe. "Who are you?"

"BlackWarGreymon. No need for thanks."

"Ah... thank you for that... but I meant your name."

He paused for two seconds, contemplating the question.

"**Owl**," he replied. "And you?"

"Just call me Sakura."

"Don't move," he said, his tone turning serious. "You're badly hurt. I must take you back for treatment immediately."

"Back... back?" I asked, my voice growing fainter as my strength ebbed away. "Where... where are we going?"

At the question, he seemed to falter for a second before quickly adding, "Don't worry about that. It’s a good place. That is... if you trust me."

He was being foolish. Why wouldn't a fallen queen trust the very knight who had come to her rescue?

"Okay," I whispered with a weary nod. "Then I'll leave it to you."

### Chapter 2: Falling Owl

Sleep claimed me for an eternity, dragging me through a delirious, feverish dreamscape where queens and knights bled into reality.

When I lost consciousness, I expected to be taken to a hospital or some similar medical facility. But when I woke, I found myself lying in a guest room, alone and unaccompanied.

Sitting on the edge of the bed, vertigo clawed at my senses, my skull a heavy anchor of dizziness. Faintly, I could hear rows of cheering and boisterous laughter from downstairs, like a collective drinking contest. From this, I deduced I was in a bar. A mirror stood in the corner of the room; through it, I saw that I still maintained the tall, elegant form of **Rosemon**. I hadn't reverted to my human self. I suspected this was because I was still within the Digital World, even if the architecture here mirrored the human hubs of Midgard.

#### [System Notification: You have one voice message. Listen?]

#### [YES]

A flickering dialogue box manifested in the air, a digital missive from my ebon savior. I presumed he feared I would wake in his absence and left this to explain the situation, preventing me from losing my bearings.

"How thoughtful," I whispered.

I clicked the button with anticipation. But as I listened, the foundations of my reality buckled and collapsed.

First, my previous assumptions were overturned. I was currently in Midgard, specifically within the **"Drink a Glass Bar"****Trial Badge****BUG**, Owl had hidden me here to lay low.

After settling me in, Owl had headed to Guild Headquarters. He intended to report the "Pervert Party's" heinous activities—hunting live humans for sport in the Digital World. Once verified, the authorities would issue "Raiding Tasks" according to the *Midgard Safety Regulations*. That grotesque "party" would be forcibly disbanded, and every member's information would be blacklisted for life.

Then came the blow: Owl wanted me to check if I could log out. The result was unfortunate—I had been reduced to a mere assembly of code, interred within the networka ghost in the machine, eternally bound to this digital purgatory.

Facing the mirror, I couldn't help but let out a bitter smile. A desire to weep surged within me, but I found no eyes to shed tears. I sought to scream, but the man responsible had already been scattered as data dust. I wanted to throw a tantrum, but the alluring reflection in the glass forbade such unrefined behavior. My heart was a chaotic swirl of emotions, a suffocating weight pressing against my chest. I took a deep breath, but nothing changed. Only then did I realize the room had no windows.

"Smart move, Bandai Sakura... or should I say, Rosemon."

I patted my delicate cheeks and decided to accept this reality for now. I needed some air. I needed to calm my mind.

I wrenched the door open and crossed the threshold, only to be met by a man's voice from the side.

"Terrible, isn't it? Leaving an injured girl alone while he goes off to play the hero. Don't blame him; that's just how he is. A bit thick-headed, treats everyone with the same stoicism. You don't exactly get used to it, even after years."

He was talking about Owl.

"Haha... I see." I leaned against the doorframe, letting out an awkward laugh. I looked at the middle-aged man before me, dressed with a certain classical, literary flair. "And you are...?"

"I'll forgive you this once, since you've just woken up," he said with a playful smirk. "Most people wouldn't dream of asking that. Not knowing who I am on my own turf... that's a bit of a faux pas, don't you think?"

He was the owner of the "Drink a Glass Bar" and the Guild Master of the guild that shared its name—the renowned "King of Insects," **Adam**.

He and Owl had known each other for years, yet he refused to call Owl a "friend," always referring to him as "that guy" or "that fellow." Guild members called him "The Boss," while other guilds knew him as an "Information Broker," as the bar's original purpose was to trade in secrets. He disliked being called "A," as he had no desire to be the "Ace" in everyone's deck.

"The voice message... you heard it?"

He tucked a coin he had been fiddling with into his pocket and turned to face me. "Heard it? The fellow recorded it in my own room. I've heard it twice; I could recite it backwards if you like."

My first impression was that he was a bit flighty—perhaps a cultural difference.

"Your Japanese is excellent."

"Ah, you caught that." He scratched his head. "I was actually speaking French, but the system auto-translates to your set language. Busted, I suppose."

"I see... So, where are you from, originally?"

"I'm **Jade's** brother."

That was a blind spot in my knowledge.

I politely explained that I was new to the Digimon Network and unfamiliar with the major figures and lore of this world. I asked him not to tease a newcomer like me.

"Ah, I see."

He apologized and, showing a more hospitable side, began to fill me in on the intricacies of this world. He spoke like a talkative uncle, covering every angle and detail. A torrential deluge of data crashed over me, a sensory overload that ignited a tingling fire across my scalp; I could barely process half of it.

"I understand," I interrupted, trying to stop the flow. "So, Owl's 'Free Birds' raiding group isn't officially recognized simply because they lack a fixed base?"

"No, no, it has nothing to do with a base," he explained patiently. "None of the Raiders have a fixed base. A huge number of them gather here at my place before heading out on explorations. At this rate, this place will turn into a free market—if it isn't one already... Sorry, I'm rambling."

"It's fine."

I maintained a composed facade, hoping he wouldn't realize I hadn't been paying much attention.

"Anyway... The 'Raiders' are a massive community, divided into the **'Big Five UN Group'**, the **'Nordic Five'**, and **'Others'**. That guy's 'Free Birds', in terms of raw power, could easily serve as a third pillar following the first two."

Owl had once belonged to the **"Imperial Dragon's Nest"** guild. He had been forced out after losing a bet.

"What kind of bet?"

"Hah, what else do men bet on? Violence or women."

**Dragon**, the representative of the Chinese Raiding Group, was the one who had made the bet with Owl. Both were members of "Imperial Dragon's Nest" and had previously defeated the Guild Master, **Yi****ShineGreymon**). They had earned the highest possible rewards: Owl received a **Crest of Courage**, while Dragon received the **Alpha Eye (Alphamon's Digicore)**. When the two of them reached the final stage of a tournament, they struck a deal: whoever lost the battle would leave the guild forever.

"He agreed to such an absurd wager!?"

"We, the audience, had the same reaction," Adam recalled. "But back then, Owl was just a fledgling who didn't know his own limits—all heart and fire. In the end, he didn't see the result coming, and we... well, we didn't see the process coming."

### Chapter 3: Stillness within the Mirror

Accepting the glass from the Boss, I retreated into the dim silence of the guest room, counting the heartbeats until Owls return.

About half an hour later, footsteps echoed in the hallway. The heavy door creaked open, admitting a man whose very presence commanded the space. He appeared to be in his mid-thirties and was dressed in a retro style—less "literary" than the owner, but sharper. He was slightly shorter than Adam, roughly the same height as my Rosemon form. A rich, magnetic resonance colored his voice, thrumming with the suppressed energy of a coiled spring.

Without any preamble, he dropped a single sentence: "You seem to be recovering well."

I struggled to find a fitting reply, so I just tilted my head and offered an awkward, faint smile to break the tension. This was, without a doubt, my knight—the ebon hero who had snatched me from the pervert's clutches: Owl.

"The bastard downstairs (the Boss) probably told you plenty of 'stories' about me, didn't he? Forget them. That's all in the past." I wasn't sure if he was talking to me or just comforting himself, but I kept smiling nonetheless.

He then inquired about my physical condition. I told him I felt restored, with no lingering discomfort. He nodded, a relieved smile touching his lips. After a moment of thought, he suggested that given the circumstances, I might need to remain under observation for a while.

"How long?" I asked.

"I don't know. It’s hard to say."

He proposed that I join his raiding group, the **"Free Birds."****"Support"** position was currently vacant, and they urgently needed a Data-attribute Digimon to fill the gap.

"Was the Support position always empty before me?"

"No," he replied. "There was an **Angewomon****Sparrow**. She and the Substitute, **Crane**, were twin sisters. Sparrow passed away from an illness. Before she left, she transferred her data to her sister, which allowed Crane—a **LadyDevimon**—to evolve into **Mastemon**."

Owl promised that if I joined them, he would do everything in his power to help me find a way back to the real world.

"Are you confident?" I asked.

"No," he answered honestly. "But I will try. I will give it everything I have. I've made many friends in this space; beyond combat, their skills in other fields far surpass mine. With their help, we might find a lead."

He didn't really need to say all that. I trusted him because he had saved me. Besides, I was alone here, with no one else to rely on. Who else could I turn to?

"And if... one day, you find a way for me to return, but you don't want me to go? What if you hide it from me?"

"I won't," he said without a second's hesitation. "You'll be with me at all times, or I'll be with you. As long as we stay together, there's trust. And where there's trust, you won't need to ask such questions."

His final words were heavy, but they carried the weight of truth.

Fearing I might be useless—nothing more than a beautiful vase in their team—I asked, "What do you all actually do? How are you different from the regular Raiders who explore unknown territories?"

"I founded 'Free Birds' for a single purpose," Owl told me. "To find and destroy the system terminal of Midgard. To sever the connection between the real network and the Digital World. I admit, it sounds like we're hackers... Fine, we *are*. But we aren't here to steal; we're here to return this world to the Digimon as a sanctuary. Human exploration will eventually pollute the Digital World entirely. When that happens, it won't just be the Digimon who suffer; our own network space will be ruined. To prevent that, we must shut the door on humanity as soon as possible."

"Shut the door?" I pondered. "Then... would I still be able to go back?"

"That’s why your situation is the priority. We have to find a way to return you before we find the terminal."

I could feel the resolve he had held since the beginning. It proved he wasn't someone who forgot his roots. He was a man worth entrusting one's life to... a shame I was a Digimon now.

Suddenly, a massive commotion erupted downstairs. It sounded like something had exploded. I flinched, my hand shaking so hard I nearly dropped my glass.

"What's happening?"

"No idea. Let's find out."

I followed Owl out the door. Down at the bar, a young man in a denim jacket was being gripped by the collar by a woman with curly, permed hair. They were in the middle of a heated argument.

The young man seemed to be an acquaintance of Owl's, as Owl immediately rushed down to the floor. I followed at a distance, making sure not to draw attention to myself. I had to remember: I wasn't just a person in a Digimon shell anymore; I *was* a Digimon.

Pushing through the noisy crowd, I found the Boss. He told me that the young man in denim was the Vanguard of the "Free Birds"?*Falcon**. Always energetic, his Digimon form was a **CresGarurumon**. He had reverted to his human form when he entered the bar, and apparently, his hand had "accidentally" brushed against the woman's backside.

The woman was the star of the "Drink a Glass Bar"?*Queen**, a **TigerVespamon**. She was notoriously petty, and the words "tolerance" or "understanding" weren't in her lexicon.

"Boss, you're the Guild Master. Is it really okay to talk about your own people like that?"

"So what? I'd say it to their faces," he whispered. "I saw the whole thing. It was a customer's bag that hit her. The Little Queen is just looking for trouble, and poor Falcon was the one she caught. Honestly, though, she's incredibly strong. She and Jade used to tear this place apart fighting. I've had to renovate more times than I can count. Her personality is as sharp as her name. Much as I hate to admit it, she feels more like the Guild Master here than I do."

"I don't understand," I said. "If you saw it, why don't you stop her?"

"I'm not obligated to," he replied dismissively. "I'm a Guild Master, not a babysitter. We're all adults here; life is stressful, and a little release now and then is understandable. Besides, this guild is... relaxed. Except during guild meetings, I let them do as they please. Any 'serious' guild wouldn't name itself after a bar, anyway."

He was playing his role as the bar owner perfectly—a spectator who didn't care as long as the furniture wasn't smashed.

I was speechless. I turned back to see Owl standing in front of Falcon, prying Queen's hand away. He was vouching for his teammate, hoping she would let it go.

"Thinking you can cop a feel and just walk away? You clearly don't know whose turf you're on!" Queen snarled.

"What do you want, then?" Owl asked calmly.

Queen's interest was piqued. She stepped forward, poking a finger into Owl's chest in a blatant provocation. "I've been looking for an excuse to kick your ass for a long time, kid. You want to dance with the Queen?"

"If that's what it takes," Owl replied in a low voice.

Wait—I didn't expect that. Would he really accept a duel just like that?

Falcon's fighting spirit was ignited by Owl's words. "Big Brother! This is my mess, let me handle it!"

"Stay calm," Owl said, his brow furrowing as he addressed Falcon in that same low tone. "Don't make it worse. You're no match for her. Stay on the sidelines."

"You think you know me that well?" Queen barked, her eyes widening as she pointed a finger at Falcon's nose. "You brat! I was the 'Queen of Insects' while you were still a glint in your mother's eye! Today, I'm going to teach you some respect for women’s bodies, you little rodent!"

"Hey, hey, hey?

The Boss finally spoke up, intervening before Falcon could retort with whatever insult he had ready.

"You three. If you're going to fight, take it outside. Don't disrupt my business. And as for the rest of you—if you're going out to watch, settle your tabs first. No credit for spectators."

As expected, nothing useful came out of his mouth.

But they respected the Guild Master enough to comply. The crowd flowed out of the bar into the clearing in front of the building. With the wind from the forest rustling through the leaves, the duel began.

#### Owl vs. Queen. BlackWarGreymon vs. TigerVespamon

There was only one condition for victory: total defeat of the opponent, by any means necessary.

"Begin!"

The referee's call was meaningless, but it served as the spark.

In an instant, both Digimon took to the air, weapons drawn. Queen met Owl's **Dramon Killers****Royal Conquests**. Clashes ignited a firestorm of sparks, the searing heat hungry enough to devour the dry brush clinging to the stone. Gale-force winds whipped out from their colliding light-blades.

Facing a fighter significantly faster than himself, Owl was forced to use his Dramon Killers purely for defense. He waited for an opening, utilizing his superior strength to parry her strikes. In a mid-air spin, he launched the **Brave Shield** from his back. It struck Queen squarely in her slender waist, causing a massive disruption in her data. The impact broke her flight momentum, and she crashed into the ground.

"Using your shield as a weapon? Not bad," she spat, pushing herself up.

"You aren't bad yourself," Owl replied.

He raised his arms, and the Brave Shield whistled back like a magnet, locking onto his back once more.

The second round began. Queen lunged forward with even greater speed than before. Owl couldn't dodge in time and was forced to cross his arms in defense. The sheer force of her momentum pushed him back, his feet struggling to find purchase in the dirt.

Queen saw her opening. One blade maintained the pressure while the other flicked upward, knocking Owl's arms aside. Her razor-sharp blue blade sliced through the red power cables on his chest. Owl stumbled back, tumbling a significant distance before rolling back to his feet.

"Try this on for size!" he barked.

He slammed his fists into the earth, gathering the latent energy of the Digital World into his palms. As he rose, he unleashed his signature move: **Dark Gaia Force**.

Queen was a seasoned warrior; she didn't flinch. She met the attack head-on with her **Mach Stinger V**. A rapid succession of thrusts pierced through the sphere of dark energy like a needle through a balloon. The resulting V-shaped explosion of light served as her counter-riposte.

"That damn shield is annoying!" she screamed.

Watching Owl absorb her counter-attack with his Brave Shield, Queen's fury reached a new peak. She didn't care if he could hear her cursing as she charged again, blades raised.

"DIE! JUST DIE!"

TigerVespamon claimed the heavens, her dive-bombing assault a lethal weight that defied any standard defense. Owl immediately adjusted his strategy. He retracted his shield and launched himself into a **Black Tornado**, spiraling upward for a direct head-on collision.

The spectators were on the edge of their seats, oblivious to the danger of the shockwaves. Most of them had retreated to the safety of the bar's doorway, using the Boss as a human shield.

"Everyone, really?" the Boss sighed. "It’s one thing to drag me out here, but the bartender is innocent. If he gets hurt, who's going to pour your drinks?"

"We have hands!" someone yelled.

"Shut up! It's getting to the good part!"

The most anxious of all was Falcon. He had already switched to his **CresGarurumon****Yellow-Beast Crescent-Blade**. He stood rigid, eyes glued to the sky, desperately rooting for his brother.

"Owl will win," I said, stepping up beside him. "Remember, birds eat insects. It’s the way of nature. It cannot be defied."

He looked at me with a blank expression, saying nothing. Then he looked back up, his eyes widening in shock. "It's over," he whispered.

A massive golden silhouette blurred across the sky. Before we could even process what it was, the figure had dropped between Owl and Queen, his massive hands catching their respective strikes from both sides.

"Wha—what is that!?"

I was stunned by the sight. It was a terrifyingly large golden figure—from below, it looked like a colossal Hercules beetle.

"**HerculesKabuterimon**," Falcon sighed, his tension finally breaking. "The Boss finally had enough."

He sat down on the ground, exhaling a long breath as he reverted to his human form.

The Guild Master, in his Digimon form, guided the two combatants back to the ground. Upon landing, he immediately reverted to his human self, clutching his palms and howling in pain. Between groans, he scolded the two of them.

"OW! OW! OW! DAMMIT! You two... you really don't pull your punches, do you? Hey! Listen to me! A duel should have some decorum! 'To the touch,' do you understand? Don't ruin our cooperation. As they say, 'take a step back today, stay friends tomorrow'..."

Surprisingly, he was a decent mediator.

Out of respect for him, the bad blood between Owl and Queen was settled, and the duel was officially over.

"Look at you two. Even Chrome Digizoid has its limits," the Boss said, flicking his finger against their metallic bodies. "Same old rule: head over to the **Hephaestus Workshop** and get yourselves patched up. Put the bill for the alloy data on my tab. Understood? And the rest of you—shows over! Go on, get!"

The Boss's generosity was legendary. I began to understand why he was so respected. Compared to the boisterous cowards he shielded, he was a class act.

"Boss, that was exciting! Barkeep, drinks on the house?" someone shouted.

"Like hell! You want me to go bankrupt? And you—didn't you skip out on your tab last time? Dammit, nobody skates on my watch! Quick—get him! Whoever catches the freeloader drinks for free!"

With a single command, a swarm of people poured out of the bar, chasing the debtor out of the guild territory. Only Owl and I—hiding by the door—and Falcon, sitting on the roof, remained.

"Big Brother, they're gone... far, far away," Falcon called down.

Owl immediately brightened. "Quick, get in there and grab some glasses before he gets back!"

I watched in disbelief as the two men scrambled into the bar. Apparently, *this* was what they had been waiting for.

Watching them bustle around the bar, I began to worry about my future here. I couldn't blame them, really. The Boss's prices were exorbitant; it was common practice for dozens of people to share a single drink. Most tables were cluttered with empty glasses, while only one or two actually smelled of alcohol.

A pair of coughs sounded behind us. The two men froze and turned toward the source.

Queen was standing there, holding a massive mug, weaving through the tables to collect every leftover drop from the abandoned glasses. Seeing us staring, she offered a smug explanation: "A good vintage should never go to waste. A clear mirror brings still water."

Whatever. I was already used to the nonsense coming out of their mouths. "Drink a Glass Bar"—where the members were exactly like their Guild Master. Not a single "serious" soul among them.

This guild was hopeless.

### Gaiden 1: Raider Rescue Operation

#### Part I: By Jade

That day, I had just finished an overseas assignment and was flying back to Paris.

Outside the airport, people from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were waiting for me. They whisked me away to a secret location—I wasn't sure exactly where, partly because of my terrible sense of direction. The entrance was a carousel in an abandoned amusement park. From there, it was a downward spiral; the winding stairs made my legs shake, and I nearly tumbled several times. I wanted to complain, but I knew these people wouldn't listen. To them, I was just a tool, and the complaints of a tool are never important.

At the bottom, maybe thirty or forty meters underground, lay a fallout shelter. I followed a corridor to the innermost room, where a screen displayed a single English word: "WELCOME."

"What's this? A surprise party?"

A cold-blooded government official handed me a glass of red wine and an EDEN sensory rig. I was instructed to log in under my own identity; "important guests" were already waiting inside.

"Why use this setup?" I asked.

"To prevent your login point from being compromised," he replied—a rare answer. "This mission is critical. It’s a diplomatic crisis, and we need a fallback. If the system deems you're in danger, we’ll trigger the extraction protocol, force-pull your data, and log you out."

They made it sound so vital. I wondered where this protectiveness was during my previous missions. Regardless, a job is a job, especially when it comes from the top.

#### [Trial ID: NO.00007]

#### [Holder: Aurélie Lefebvre]

#### [Raider Identity: Jade]

#### [Digimon: BanchoStingmon]

#### [Guild: Drink a Glass Bar]

I logged in. Let’s see what kind of "good news" was waiting for me.

After the usual three-second lag, I materialized in the center of the **"Raider Conference."** Every eye in the room turned toward me, as if I were some curious specimen in a zoo.

"16:09 Paris time. Am I late?"

"No, just in time."

My old acquaintance, **Metal**, stood up to greet me warmly. Beside him sat another familiar face?*Dragon**.

"Aren't you going to say hello?" I asked Dragon.

He stared at me for a long time without speaking. I sent him a wink, and he looked genuinely stunned. It’s hard to imagine anyone resisting a blonde's charm, but perhaps he just didn't have a taste for Caucasians.

The seat for the US representative, **Zero**, was marked with an "ABSENT" tag. Figures. No one really understands that guy—or wants to. Every time we cross paths, he remains a silent, brooding enigma.

"It's better he’s not here," a voice said.

**Lana**, the UK representative, materialized and spoke to me from the front row. "Even if he showed up, he'd probably just parrot his superiors: 'My **Jesmon** only knows how to fight, not rescue. Find someone else.'"

I couldn't help but agree.

Among the "UN Big Five," only Lana and I were women. Metal, Dragon, and Zero were just mindless fighting machines—cold fighting machines with zero sense of romance or atmosphere. I shared no common ground with them. Whenever the Big Five went on joint explorations, I usually stuck with Lana. At least she had a better sense of direction; I couldn't find my way out of my own front door without a map.

"How are you and **Poseidon**?" I asked.

"Check this out." She showed me her ring. Her boyfriend, the Guild Master of **"Atlantis,"** had finally proposed last week.

"Gosh! You're going to be a Guild Master's wife!"

"Shh—it’s even better than that." She whispered that the proposal happened in the real world. She never imagined her online partner would be a member of the British Royal Family. I didn't press for details; some secrets are best kept.

"And you said yes?"

"The ring is already on. There's no escaping now."

I'll admit to a twinge of jealousy, but I swallowed it. I was happy for her.

The room filled up. Seventeen representatives—enough to prove the severity of the situation.

The moderator appeared and laid out the mission: **Rescue.** The South Korean Raider had vanished during a routine exploration. It had been over three days since last contact—officially a security crisis. Nineteen countries had responded, though most just wanted to "evaluate" before committing their representatives.

"Why not let those already exploring the area check it out?" the Italian representative asked.

The moderator shook his head. "**Siegfried** (the German representative) went to check. He’s also missing."

"So we’re rescuing both?" Metal asked.

"More than that. We also need to find four members of **'The Holy Knights'****Rasielmon****Raguelmon**. It started as an internal guild matter, but their 'Targeted Raider Group' chased the rampaging beast into the same sector where the Korean and German Raiders vanished. They haven't been heard from since."

"What kind of sector are we talking about?" asked **Ruki**, the Japanese representative.

"A desert. Empty. Nothing but sand."

"Count me out then," Lana said, withdrawing the UK's support. "Have fun, everyone."

I couldn't blame her. Her guild, **"Atlantis,"** consisted of aquatic Digimon. A desert was certain death for them.

"What's the danger level?" Dragon asked.

"Undetermined. For now, we are treating it as **Level Terminal**."

The room went cold.

"Are you joking? Terminal Level? You want us to die!?"

"Exactly! No one’s going to risk that!"

The Italian and Canadian representatives voiced their protest. The "Nordic Five" along with the representatives from Arabia, India, Egypt, and Australia all shook their heads and withdrew. In the end, only Metal, Dragon, Ruki, the Spanish representative, and I remained.

The moderator looked disappointed. He told us to check with our superiors before finalizing the decision.

"No need," Dragon said, raising his hand. "China is in."

"You sure you don't want to discuss it?"

"Discussion is useless," Dragon replied sharply. "By the time they finish their meeting, those two will be data dust. They'll tell me not to go anyway. Better to move now—retrieving corpses is better than nothing."

His words moved me. I didn't know he had such a human side.

"You can't go alone without a driver," Metal added.

"I can fly."

"Flying isn't as comfortable as a private express. Let me give you a lift."

"Save a seat for me," I said, moving to sit beside them. "You'll need a blonde to keep watch—and an excellent **Vanguard**."

I was the designated Vanguard of the Big Five, and I wasn't giving up that title.

Metal smiled and gave me a high-five. "Perfect. The three of us, then."

"Where are the other two?" Metal asked, looking around.

"Gone," Dragon grunted. He began recalibrating his transport rig according to the mission data. "The Japanese fox and the Spanish oarfish got cold feet. One’s a card player, the other’s a diver—unreliable. Better they didn't come; they’d only hold us back."

He said "us," not "me." That was high praise from Dragon. He rarely acknowledged anyone, save for Zero. Even the ten Guild Masters didn't impress him; he only showed respect to my brother, Adam, mostly to get out of paying his bar tab.

"You seem confident," I noted.

"I’ll do better than those two (the Korean and German reps), at least."

Rescue missions differ from standard raids. The lineup was set: Metal as **Extraction**, myself as **Cover**, and Dragon as **Rearguard**.

We were transported to the coordinates. Our forms shifted: I became the aerial **BanchoStingmon**; Metal transformed into the massive armored train, **GrandLocomon**; and Dragon became his terrifyingly powerful form?*Dorugoramon**.

"All aboard, partners. The express is leaving the station."

Dragon and I clung to the back of the armored locomotive. With a blast of the whistle, we surged forward. The mission had begun.

---

#### (Part II) - By Metal

First, an apology. I kept certain things from the Raiders.

I was raised in the Russian military; my father is a high-ranking general and the Guild Master of **"Steel Legions."**

I had slept in until noon. When I woke, I found him staring at his tablet, his brow furrowed deep enough to crush a fly. I asked what happened. He said it was serious and turned the screen around.

The video showed a group of **Myotismon**, bearing the insignia of the "Pervert Party." They were in a dark, shaded forest, dragging a shivering **Angewomon** from a coffin. They bound her with "Bloody Whips" and swarmed her with "Grisly Wing." They tore at her wings, ripped away her mask, and sank their fangs into her flesh, treating her like livestock.

"Gosh... what is this?" I could barely watch.

"Look what happens next..."

The perverts injected her with their viral code. The small Vaccine-type Digimon underwent a horrific mutation—evolving into **Ofanimon: Falldown Mode**.

"A fallen angel... slaughtering demons."

The **Flame Hellscythe** reaped the lives of the Myotismon, her silhouette drifting deeper into the forest.

"So, we have a job?"

He didn't deny it. "Think of the safety risks... a rampaging fallen angel wandering the Digital World, killing indiscriminately..."

"Fine, fine. I'll go."

But then he added something crucial: "Do not mention this to any of the Raiders."

I drank a glass of milk to steady my nerves. "Why not?"

"The legality of the recording is... questionable."

Typical. He had been spying on them. This was Russian intelligence, not to be shared. You never know how other nations will react.

I volunteered to be the driver for Jade and Dragon out of guilt.

We surged across the desert on the tracks I laid down myself. A sandstorm hit us, blinding and fierce. I slowed down so the two on my back could search for survivors.

"Found them yet?" I called out. "Am I going too fast?"

"Keep this pace," Dragon replied.

"We need time," Jade added.

The desert was empty, save for a few stray **Tortomon**—likely refugees fleeing something terrible.

Soon, Jade spotted a South Korean flag. We found the Raider, **Lanshen**, half-buried in the sand. His left side was digitizing, and his **MirageGaogamon** armor was shattered beyond repair. His core was intact, but he’d need days of treatment to work for the Korean government again.

As we loaded him aboard, Jade touched his armor. "**Chrome Digizoid**... shredding this requires at least a Mega-level attacker. If there’s only one of them, we might be outmatched."

"Have some faith," Dragon scoffed. "Chrome Digizoid isn't that rare among Megas. It’s nothing special."

His words reminded me of my own goal. Next time, I wanted to shift into a Chrome Digizoid form. Only Russia had the "persuasive" power to force developers to leave a bug in the code for that kind of mod.

Dragon looked around. "Metal, I found another piece of metal."

It was a terrible pun, but it worked. We found **Siegfried**, the German Raider. He was a **Slayerdramon** now, but he was in bad shape—riddled with holes. More disturbingly, his German flag cape was missing its yellow section, cut away clean by something other than physical face. His core was damaged. He was dying.

"What kind of thing can take down two Chrome Digizoid Megas?" Jade asked.

"A monster. Or Dragon," I said, glancing at him. "Or you, if you tried harder."

"Me? I'd need something to pierce that armor first."

"Those stingers on your arms don't count?"

"I could scratch it," she admitted. "But I’d need the Boss's strength to punch through."

True. Very few could match Adam’s raw power. Dragon was one of them—an undefeated king of accidents.

Siegfried muttered something to Dragon before losing consciousness. Time was running out.

"Get him on board!" I shouted. "We have more passengers!"

"Forget it," Dragon said, his voice grim. "The members of 'The Holy Knights' have already boarded the express to the underworld. You can't catch them."

"Who’s the driver of that express?" I asked.

"A fallen archangel..."

Before he could finish, red laser beams rained down from the sky. The attack was sudden. I jerked my armored chassis sideways, shielding Jade. Dragon vanished from his spot.

"DRAGON!" Jade screamed.

"Don't be stupid! He’s fine!"

Dragon hated sneak attacks. He wouldn't miss a chance to show off. He vanished into the sky, his massive wings carrying him toward the lasers.

We loaded the unconscious Siegfried. I don't have much sympathy for him—he was always looking for excuses when he failed. But duty is duty.

High above the clouds, the culprit revealed itself: **Ordinemon**. A massive, grotesque fusion of Raguelmon and Ofanimon: Falldown Mode. A sick mockery of order.

Its wing-arms seized Dragon, pinning his limbs. It dragged him to its face, opening its maw to gather energy for its **End of the World** blast. A direct hit would be terminal.

But Dragon wouldn't just sit there. He used his wings to break the grip, then spun his body, slamming his mace-like tail into the monster’s head, grounded it instantly.

As the wings tried to seize him again, I surged forward on my tracks. My massive locomotive wheels ground into the monster’s wings, my engine glowing with energy. I unleashed a **Destructive Impact**, grinding the black hands into data.

"Jade, we have to finish this!" I shouted.

"On it!" She took flight from my back, signaling for me to move the survivors to safety.

I am an Extraction Specialist. I knew when to leave. I had faith in them.

---

#### (Part III) - By Dragon

Before I get to the main story, let me tell you about a girl named **Wang**.

She was a fellow guild member who looked up to me. She was always pestering me to take her as a disciple. I refused at first, telling her to follow the Guild Master instead. But she was stubborn. In the end, I let her follow me.

Then came **Lucemon: Falldown Mode**. She saved my life, taking the **Dead or Alive****Ouryumon**, unable to log out.

She hid in a cave by a lake, thinking she was protecting me from the "trouble" she’d cause. She thought I didn't know she was there. But fish don't just appear in a stagnant lake—I put them there. I just wanted to make sure she was eating. Nothing more.

Anyway, back to business.

GrandLocomon ground the monster’s wings, and Jade moved in to support. I didn't need it, but I didn't want to hurt them with my own splash damage.

"Fast work, Vanguard," I teased Jade. "Hope you didn't pull a muscle."

She rolled her eyes. "Got a plan to kill this thing?"

"Plans aren't thought up," I said. "They're *done*."

I stopped thinking. I focused on the enemy. No strategy. Just raw power.

"Ready, Jade? It’s getting up."

"Let's go!"

We blurred toward the target. Jade struck first, using her head-butt to disrupt the monster’s energy gathering. She followed up with explosive mechanical insects to blind it.

I gathered flame in my hands, targeting the green and purple orbs on its wings. Jade triggered her arm drills. We punched through the creature together, forcing it back into the mountainside. Its cores shattered. Its head was a mess of data.

"Your turn, Dragon!"

"Watch closely."

Ordinemon used its last reserves for one final **End of the World****Multi-Discordance**.

The two beams collided, warping the space around us. But there was no contest.

Ordinemon vanished in the explosion, its data scattered. I stood my ground, unmoved. Once again, I had proven that I am the **Dragon King**.

I returned to headquarters, endured the empty praise of cowards, and maintained my stoic persona. I had an appointment.

I went to see Xiao Wang. She had finally spotted me.

"Master!" She lunged at me, coiling her massive dragon body around mine. Her swords scraped against my armor. I put a hand on her head and pushed her back.

"Scrape my armor again and I'll skin you."

"Don't be so mean! I missed you!"

"Is that why you ran away without a word?"

"I didn't want to be a burden!"

"You think I see you as a burden?"

"You don't, but others might... I don't want to drag you down."

I sighed. I had no counter for her logic. She’d just act cute or pout.

"Anyone visit lately?" I asked.

"Yeah. Some **BlackWarGreymon**."

Rare breed. I thought for a second. Ah, the "Owl" kid I beat back then.

"What did he want?"

"He blew up a bunch of 'Pervert Party' creeps. He asked for directions, and I pointed him toward the forest."

Just another hero playing knight. Typical for this world.

"Take care of yourself," I told her. "Eat three meals a day. Understand? Three."

"Yes, Master!"

"Wipe that grin off your face." I knocked her on the head, the metal ringing for a long time.

"Does your hand hurt?" she asked.

"No. Why would it?"

"Because my body is hard."

"Shut up. Keep your blades sharp. Your left one is getting rusty. Don't embarrass me."

"Understood, Master!"

I sent her off to catch fish. Now, it was time for the uninvited guest.

"The show's over," I said to the shadows. "You coming out, or do I have to drag you?"

**Zero** emerged, laughing softly. "When did you notice?"

"Since you started following me. Why the interest? Looking for a fight? Or just a thrill? It’s all the same to me. Some people just need a lesson. Right, **Jesmon**?"

Zero smiled. He said he wasn't on a mission; it was his own choice. I didn't believe him. A tool doesn't have choices.

"Good job on the mission, Dragon."

"Save the fake praise," I spat. "I know about your hacks. You’re not that clever. You, and that Jesmon form of yours."

Zero’s Jesmon had been modified by US intelligence—a lone wolf that could shift its data volume at will. A shameless cheat.

"Since you know that... perhaps your days are numbered."

"Try me," I grinned. "I'm always ready."

The tension was electric. He didn't back down. He was a true fighter, at least.

"Another time," he said, merging back into the shadows. "And a word of advice: don't get too curious. For your sake. And hers."

"Thanks for the tip," I said, my voice cold. "But if anything happens to her, you're the first one I’m coming for."

"We'll see."

The bastard left. I looked back at Xiao Wang’s cave. My chest felt tight.

"Xiao Wang! Come here!"

"What is it, Master?"

"We're leaving. I’m finding you a new place."

"Where?"

"You'll see."

### Chapter 4: The Dove and the Heron

During this time, I recounted the ordeal I had suffered to Owl, placing particular emphasis on my need to find the "Little Snake" in the **Nature Court**. After listening, he nodded in agreement, promising to accompany me there in a few days.

"Why wait a few days?" I asked.

"Because the **Nature Court** is currently undergoing internal space maintenance. Their guild domain is inaccessible. If we want to find the snake, we can only roam other parts of the Midgard and hope for a stroke of luck."

That seemed like searching for a needle in a haystack. I never trusted my luck; it was as fickle as it was unfortunate.

I turned back to Owl. "What are your plans for the next few days? You can't expect me to hide in this bar's backroom forever. It’s stuffy in here; I’m going stir-crazy."

What I really meant was: *I want to go for a stroll.* But he countered with, "If you find it too stuffy, you could just open the door and let the outside air in. That should help."

Ugh—I was losing my mind. I constantly felt like I was talking to a block of wood.

He added, "If you're truly bored, I can introduce you to Dove and Heron. I expect a mission will come our way soon; consider it early team-building."

He truly was a dedicated leader, constantly preoccupied with his "Raiding" business. Every word out of his mouth was about missions. What was I to him? A giant, wandering rose? It felt as if my personal matters were never even on his radar.

Since I had no other options, I accepted.

The following day, Owl brought Falcon and two new members to the bar to meet me. We gathered in the warehouse of the **Drink a Glass Bar**—a place where we wouldn't be disturbed or overheard. Over two pitchers of beer provided by the boss, we engaged in the usual small talk, trying to familiarize ourselves with one another.

Dove was a boy who looked younger than me, while Heron was a girl who appeared older. The former possessed a gentle temperament; he greeted me warmly and was genuinely enthusiastic about my joining. He was shorter than I was, dressed like the boy next door. The latter, however, was as cold as ice. She merely offered a "Yo" upon meeting me. Slim and possessing a dark, stylish aura, she was like a "Flower on a High Ridge"—aloof and unapproachable.

"Hello, Sakura," Dove said, stepping forward to take my hand. "We heard about what happened to you from Uncle Owl on the way here."

"Is that so? And what did he say?"

"He..."

Dove shot a cautious glance toward Owl. Owl merely tilted his head, acting as if he didn't care, and shrugged, signaling Dove to choose his words carefully.

"He... well, he said nothing but good things." Dove swallowed hard. "He said you were kind and beautiful... and he even praised your tolerance for alcohol, saying you never get drunk no matter how much you drink."

Heh. Men and their lies. I didn't want to make things difficult for the boy, so I let it slide.

The other one was far more aggressive than the gentle Dove. She approached me and, without asking, lifted a lock of my golden hair to her nose, inhaling deeply. "Not bad," she remarked. "Quite fragrant."

It was a redundant statement. I was a Rosemon; of course I didn't smell like trash.

Naturally, I couldn't say that to her face. Meeting someone for the first time, I wanted to leave a good impression. I maintained a humble posture and replied, "You flatter me... I just... I take good care of myself."

Sensing the mounting tension, Owl stepped in to change the subject, officially introducing me to the three of them. "Starting today, Sakura officially joins the **Free Birds****Support**. Everyone, communicate and learn from each other. We need to build rapport quickly for our next **Raid**."

Heron spoke up coldly. "When?"

"Soon," Owl replied. "The Host said once he’s finished with his current tasks, he’ll arrange the next mission immediately. The payment is generous—not just currency, but also a batch of **Temp-Patch Data**."

**Temp-Patch Data****Raiding Group** possessed such items, and even then, only in small quantities. Though they were sold on the black market, the prices were exorbitant, far beyond the reach of ordinary residents.

Falcon raised his hand. "I have a question!"

"Speak."

"Sakura... well, I’ll just be blunt. Please don't take offense." Falcon turned to me, his gaze direct. "How much confidence do you have in your own strength? Can you actually assist us in a formal **Raid**?"

As Falcon spoke, every eye in the room turned toward me, waiting for an answer.

How convenient. I wanted to know the answer to that myself.

Seeing my hesitation, Owl understood the situation and stepped in to bail me out. "Don't be too hard on her. She only recently took on this form and hasn't even learned how to use her skills. She'll need time to practice. Don't expect too much from her initially, and absolutely do not compare her to Sparrow. Especially you, Little Heron. She is Sakura, our new member, not a replacement for your sister. I won't have you speaking to her with that sharp tongue of yours."

"You certainly like to meddle," Heron muttered under her breath.

"What was that?"

"Nothing." She turned to me, raising her voice. "Newcomer, the **Support****Vanguard****Tank**'s blind spots are covered, whether the **Vanguard****Reserve** can swap in effectively—all of that falls on you. Don't let us down."

Having said her piece, Heron picked up her refilled mug and walked out of the warehouse toward the bar for a refill. Only the four of us remained, and the tension finally began to dissipate.

"Don't mind her, Sakura," Dove urged, stepping forward to comfort me. "Heron has been this way ever since her sister passed away. She hasn't smiled since. Just let her words go in one ear and out the other. It’s nothing personal."

"Exactly," Falcon added. "She’s always putting pressure on people, especially me. If you see us arguing in the future, don't worry about it. It’s just our daily routine."

Owl cuffed the back of Falcon's head. "Nonsense. You're always the one causing trouble."

"It’s true though!" Falcon complained, rubbing his head. "She’s always the one starting it. I didn't do anything to her, yet she’s always moping around like a widow. They were born from the same mother, but Sparrow was so much gentler than her."

"Enough. One more word and I’ll tell them about how you tried to hit on?

"No! My mistake! Brother, please don't!" Falcon immediately folded. "I still want to leave a good impression on Sakura. Please, stop right there."

Their bond was admirable. I couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy.

I was curious about this "Sparrow" person. She seemed like the true core of this team—at least based on their reactions. I turned to Dove for confirmation. "Sparrow... were you all very close to her?"

"Of course," Dove said with pride. "She was like our angel, the soul of the **Free Birds**. It might sound strange, but every bit of comfort we found in this team came from Sparrow. Every wound in our hearts, every shadow—Sparrow was the one who healed us. We are all deeply grateful to her and loved her... but in the end, alas, the Captain swooped in and took her."

"Wait... what?" I felt as if the ground had shifted. "What did Owl do to her?"

"He didn't tell you?" Dove's surprise mirrored my own. "He beat us to the punch. He confessed his feelings to Sparrow, she agreed, and they became a couple."

Good heavens. My world-view was crumbling.

"Wait, let me get one thing straight... how old was Sparrow at the time?"

"Age? Let me think... she wasn't that old. Maybe five years older than me. Twenty-three."

I had thought Owl was a man of high character, but now it turned out he had dated someone young enough to be his daughter. The most critical part was that Owl had told me about his life in the real world—he was married and had a daughter, though he had left them for reasons that were hard to vocalize.

I knew it. Men were all the same.

"And... Owl, after Sparrow left... he never thought about finding someone else?"

"No," Dove told me. "Sparrow is a hurdle his heart can't clear. He can't forget her. For a long time after she was gone, he’d still call out her name in his sleep."

"So, you all know each other... in the real world?"

"Not exactly. Uncle Owl told me himself," Dove admitted. "I met Sparrow once in reality. I was on a school trip to Okinawa and ran into her at a souvenir shop. She was a beautiful woman—more like a kind, elder sister type. As for Falcon, Owl told me he’s a taxi driver in the real world; he spends his breaks in here for a few days (minutes). But Owl and Heron... I’ve never met them outside of this space."

Through Dove's narrative, I gained a preliminary understanding of these five. They were all ordinary people in the real world, none of them government agents. This meant their Raids had no safety net.

I asked Dove, "By the way, what is your Digimon form?"

"Ah, I forgot to tell you. I’m a massive **MegaGargomon**. Your five-man team's indestructible shield, the **Tank**, and the mobile turret with the most concentrated firepower." He spoke with such confidence he didn't even notice my expression.

"Sounds reliable."

"It has to be!"

I couldn't call him narcissistic; he was just very genuine. Compared to the others, he was much easier to get along with.

"To tell you the truth," his voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper, "the **Tank** in this team doesn't just hold off enemies; occasionally, I have to hold off our own people."

"Our own?"

"Yeah. They start fighting each other at the drop of a hat. I’m the one in charge of breaking it up. Usually, it’s just me and Uncle Owl, but if the day ever comes when *he's* the one getting violent, it’ll be up to you."

He didn't need to tell me. That was the duty of a **Support**.

Heron returned with a refilled mug and told us she had overheard something while waiting. Some people at the next table were talking about the **Raiders UN Big Five**—specifically something concerning the sister of Adam, the Guild Master.

"I asked the Master, and he confirmed it. The rescued Korean and German representatives are in bad shape. The German rep even suffered damage to his DigiCore. No one knows how long it’ll take him to recover."

Owl looked curious. "When did this happen?"

"Just recently. Yesterday, to be precise."

"Yesterday..."

Owl rested his chin on his hand, falling into deep thought.

"Is there a problem?" I asked.

He shook his head. "No problem... it’s just strange."

According to Owl, he had happened to visit the **Core Forge** yesterday. He was there to ask the smiths if there was any way to deal with my situation, though he came up empty-handed. As he was leaving, he had nearly run into the German representative, Siegfried. If Heron’s story was true, he should have been there for DigiCore repair, but the man didn't look injured at all. In fact, he was as lively as a monkey, nearly knocking Owl over.

"That shouldn't be possible," Owl muttered, staring at his beer mug. "Generally, repairing a shattered DigiCore requires the participation of every smith in the **Core Forge**, working for at least six days (reality units) just to match and patch the missing data. Unless the German government has mastered some technology that can rapidly regenerate a DigiCore?"

"No way," Falcon sighed. "If that's true, wouldn't he be immortal? That's just cheating!"

"It’s just my own speculation. There’s no evidence, so we can't jump to conclusions."

Dove mirrored Owl's thoughtful pose for a moment, then slapped his forehead. "I almost forgot... I know someone who’s quite close to Siegfried. I could go find him and have him pull some strings to ask about the situation. See if Uncle Owl’s theory holds water."

The idea was met with unanimous approval.

Heron was the first to react. She let out a cold snort, swirling her beer. "Who would have thought a student like you would have such broad connections?"

"Don't underestimate students. Communication is much easier between peers."

"Mature for your age," Heron said with a disdainful roll of her eyes. Her next words floored me: "I’ll leave it to you, then."

I was finding it harder and harder to pin down her personality. Perhaps her true self was entirely different from the impression she gave. We were probably just biased.

Once we finished our beer, the "Free Birds" internal meeting officially concluded.

Before we dispersed, the four of them unanimously decided that I should undergo adaptive combat training. Each of them would take a day to spar with me as my coach. Only through actual combat could I develop my instincts and improve my level—until this "Big Red Flower" was worthy of them.

I raised my thorn-wrapped hand in protest, but my objection was swiftly overruled. They happily decided on the schedule without even consulting me. In my naivety, I still thought this was a civilized world where intellect could solve everything. They were about to give me a cruel but necessary lesson: right now, I was a Digimon, not a human.

They drew straws to determine the order of my training.

Dove excitedly grabbed my wrist and high-fived it. "I’m first tomorrow! Get ready for the 'Dove' rocket barrage, haha!"

Falcon seemed equally expectant. "Me and my **Yellow Beast Crescent Blade** will be waiting for you on the second day. Good luck."

The third day fell to Owl. He promised, "Don't worry. I’ll go easy on you."

I certainly hoped he’d keep his word.

The thing I understood the least was the final day. Heron was actually the one who would "inspect" my results. I was terrified she’d hold a grudge and fight for real, using her full strength against me.

To prevent that, Owl specifically warned her, "I’m giving you a heads-up. Your opponent is a newcomer. No matter what the situation looks like, you are forbidden from using **Chaos Flare**."

"As if I needed you to tell me."

Her response was as cold and unfeeling as ever, enough to send a shiver down my spine. At this point, I could only pray that I wouldn't die at the hands of my own teammates over the next four days. If I did, my mother would surely laugh at me.

"Oh please, my daughter only has this level of skill? All those years I spent evolving into a Rosemon were for nothing. How pathetic, she can't even beat her own people."

Being mocked by the real thing would be the ultimate blow. I had only just parted from her and didn't want to reunite just yet. So, I decided to rise up, to work hard, and to show them the true me. From now on, there was a phrase I’d keep on my lips:

Rosemon might lose, but I, Bandai Sakura, will never surrender!

"Come on, let’s start with a few kilometers of jogging to warm up."

"I quit!"

### Chapter 5: An Earth-Shattering Practical Duel

The "Dove of Peace," usually so mild-mannered, will still peck you if you force its hand.

Upon switching to his **MegaGargomon** form, Dove underwent a total metamorphosis. In an instant, he became a violent force of nature, completely unrecognizable from the boy I had just met. Regardless of whether I was ready for combat, he deployed every weapon port on his massive frame and unleashed a relentless barrage of fire in my direction.

I missed the gentle version of him from yesterday. He had initially chosen **Terriermon** as his avatar simply because he thought the little thing was "cute." Who could possibly connect that person to the war machine currently chasing me with "Burst Shots"? Actually, I’m being generous—now he was locking on to me with his shoulder-mounted "Giant Missiles." I wasn't even sure if he was used to aiming; I, someone with almost no combat experience, found it relatively easy to dodge.

"Taste this! Ahahaha—another laser blast, *bong*! Direct hit! Run, run! Super big missiles incoming, ahahahahaha?"

The man was in a state of sheer frenzy, completely deaf to reason. He had utterly forgotten Owl’s instructions, laying waste to the surrounding area of the **Drink a Glass Bar**’s domain. Flowers were crushed, grass was ignited, rocks were shattered, and even the topsoil was upturned. I could already imagine that when this ended, Adam would surely drag him back and force him into a week of hard labor to compensate for the damage.

He blasted and bombed, and I fled and dodged. I was driven into a corner, yet I couldn't seem to put enough distance between us. His frame was too massive, and being machine-driven, he didn't have to worry about stamina. I, on the other hand, had only two legs—supported by heels, no less. Before I had gone far, my legs were trembling, and without a moment to pause and catch my breath, I wouldn't have been able to continue.

"Giant Missiles" have an incredibly wide blast radius, which meant I had to move faster. But how much faster could I go? Human strength couldn't compete with a machine—unless I found a way to stop the machine.

Observing his rhythm, I noticed a window of time after he fired his missiles where his body automatically reloaded. This was my chance. I locked onto his massive shoulder missile bays, lashed out with my **Thorn Whip**, and pulled myself up. He didn't notice me. This gave me the opening I needed. When the hatch opened to fire again, I swung my whip to wrap around his neck as I dropped, while simultaneously lunging with my **Rose Rapier**, piercing a missile that hadn't yet launched.

The internal explosion caused a chain reaction, setting off the gunpowder reserves throughout his frame. His heavy body slammed into the ground, a plume of black smoke erupting from his mouth as his eyes lost their light. I had won my first match, though I didn't consider it a true victory—more of a clever trick.

"You did well!"

Reverting to his human form and lying on his back, Dove gave me a thumbs-up. "Tomorrow, you'll face Falcon. He’s a master of speed. If you're not careful, the match will be over before it starts. Be on your guard."

I took his words to heart, but they didn't help much. Falcon's speed was beyond anything I had imagined, leaving me no time to react. I deeply regretted not doing more homework the night before; otherwise, I wouldn't have been so humiliated the next day.

A golden whirlwind tore toward me. I couldn't escape, I couldn't hide, and there was nowhere to run. My **Thorn Whip****Beast-Wolf Great Rotation**. Before I could even draw my **Rose Rapier**, he swung his blade's hilt and swept me off my feet. He then stepped onto my waist, seemingly admiring the view from above. If it hadn't been for my cry of pain, he would have won then and there.

"Whoops, my bad."

"How could you be so rude to a lady!"

"Accident, accident. Didn't watch my strength... Hey, you can still stand up!"

He probably thought that pinning me by the waist would allow him to dominate the match, but I wouldn't let him have his way. There’s a tactic called "playing hard to get," and it was perfect for someone like him.

I deliberately swayed my hips as I pushed myself up from the ground, luring him to approach from behind. Then, I delivered a sharp backwards kick directly to his face. Let’s see him dodge *that*.

"Oh my, why were you standing behind me? I didn't see you. So sorry."

He rolled around on the ground, clutching his head. Apparently, his wolf skull wasn't as hard as he thought.

Taking the opportunity, I lashed out with my **Thorn Whip**, first disarming him of his **Yellow Beast Crescent Blade**, then binding his body. I expended a small amount of data to unleash a high-voltage current. Even Chromes Digizoid is conductive—it was enough to keep him twitching for a while.

"Mr. Vanguard, what’s wrong? Am I so beautiful that you found the experience... electrifying?" I teased, walking over to my defeated opponent. I knelt beside him, lifting his wolf-head chin with one hand. "Listen, if you want my **Support** in future missions, keep your eyes off certain parts of my body. Otherwise, I’ll make sure you enjoy that numb, tingling sensation a few more times. Understand?"

He didn't respond, which meant he was still thinking about it. Fine then—I’d just increase the voltage.

"Wait! I... I understand! I understand!"

He forced those words out through gritted teeth. At first, I thought he was choking on something, but then I realized my whip was wrapped so tightly around his neck he could barely breathe.

If the first two victories were due to luck, the next two were nearly the death of me.

Against Owl, I was powerless. A **BlackWarGreymon** is a natural-born warrior—balanced in offense and defense, and surprisingly fast. Being a Virus-type, crushing a weak Data-type like me was child's play.

Perhaps Owl realized this himself. Before our match began, he removed the **Dramon Killers****Brave Shield** on his back. It was a gesture of immense sincerity. Displaying the powerful musculature of a dragon-warrior, he challenged me: "Come, Sakura. Let me see the true strength of the 'Queen of Nature.'"

Was he talking about me? I was curious too. Might as well show him, lest he call me a "drag" in the future.

"Go easy on me," I reminded him. "Don't be too rough with us girls."

"I know. You can rest easy," he promised again. "I won't use any lethal moves today. Come at me."

As soon as he finished speaking, my **Thorn Whip** lashed out. Owl reacted instantly, sidestepping the strike before closing the distance at breakneck speed. Seeing him approach, I adjusted my stance and retreated to a safe distance, darting into a nearby thicket. I moved through the shadows, deliberately brushing against leaves to create distractions before suddenly lunging from his blind spot.

My **Rose Rapier** was less than fifty centimeters from his back. For a split second, I actually thought about pulling back. He was going easy on me, and here I was using a backstab. It felt dishonorable. But before I could retract the blade, he spun around and caught the rapier by the blade. The tip was mere centimeters from his left eye. A hair's breadth away. If he had been half a second later, he would have been in agony tonight.

"A poisoned blade? How insidious," he remarked calmly. "But your technique is lacking."

He was saying I lacked strength. I could admit that. I wasn't a warrior; why would I need that kind of power?

"The battlefield isn't just for warriors," I told him. "It’s for women too."

What I really meant was: *Don't underestimate "Bandai Sakura." I might seem weak to you, but I’m a handful. You’d better watch out, or you’ll find yourself in the "Rose Cradle" dreaming of your little lover, being whipped by her.* Hypnosis is the best weapon against the strong; even the slightest lapse in concentration can be fatal.

"Do you think I can't smell the fragrance?" He asked slowly, holding his breath. "One or two experiences are enough to get used to such tricks. Stop wasting your effort. Just give up."

My plan had been seen through instantly. I had no choice but to pin my hopes on one last thing: **Danger Thorn**. I unleashed a barrage of thorns, hoping they would buy me enough time and energy to activate my ultimate move.

Unlike the previous days, I had come prepared. I had visited Adam, and through him, learned about my own weaknesses—and the common weakness of all Pixie-type Digimon: we are terrible at close combat.

"It’s not that you're *good* at long-range either," Adam had remarked. "Strictly speaking, every individual has their niche. It’s about whether you can find it. But honestly, against us Vaccine-types, you Data-types have a real advantage."

I took his words to heart. My primary goal was to deal with Heron on the final day. As for Owl... from the beginning, I never believed I could beat him alone. Everything I was doing now was just stubborn resistance—a way to temper my will against the strong.

As Owl wove through the thorns, closing in on me, I still couldn't find the opening for my finisher. I cast the thought aside and lunged with my **Rose Rapier**. As expected, he charged straight at me. I lured him in, retreating just enough to whip my **Thorn Whip** around him, binding him just as I had Falcon.

It was effective.

He was electrocuted until his limbs went soft, and though he couldn't speak, he didn't give up. He forced himself to stay upright, one hand gripping the whip as he pulled—turning the tables and pulling me toward him.

"Let... let go!" I stammered, panicking.

"If you don't release it, I won't let go."

Owl was determined to hold out. I had no choice but to comply; I couldn't win against him anyway.

The moment the whip slackened, Owl broke free. He then yanked on the whip, pulling me straight into his arms. If this were a cliché drama, my heart would have been racing. But all I felt was a headache. The steel of his chest armor was as hard as Chromes Digizoid. I honestly thought that if he had used any more force, I would have been crushed to death. He’d be left holding a corpse.

"If you wanted me dead, you could have just said so."

I rubbed my head, pouting at him. Through the gaps in my fingers, I watched his reaction. He looked lost, staring down at his chest where I had just bumped into him. He then brought his hand to his nose and sniffed, remarking that it was "quite fragrant."

Is there something wrong with these people? Why do they keep doing that? First Heron, now him. Who’s next? I couldn't even imagine Dove or Falcon doing it. Dove was too kind; saying something like that would feel like a forced compliment and shatter my image of the sweet boy next door. Falcon was likely to use his lecherous nature to try something—he was the one I really had to watch out for. Actually, it wouldn't be hard; like I said, I’d just shock him every time I caught him.

"Heron is inspecting me tomorrow. Any advice or warnings?"

"She’s strong."

Brilliant. I knew that already.

"And...?"

"The arrow from her right arm is 'Holy Hope.' The left arm will seize the opponent's DigiCore to crush and delete it; that move is called 'Dark Despair.' As you can tell, 'Despair' carries more weight, making her extremely dangerous."

"Is there a way to avoid being grabbed?"

"Running faster than her—which is impossible for you. You'll just have to prevent her from using the move in the first place."

To win with "Hope" while avoiding "Despair" required one thing: attacking from a distance.

But when I finally stood before Heron, I realized I wouldn't even have the chance. Her movement was too fast. She didn't turn into a whirlwind like Falcon, but I still couldn't track her movements. If I couldn't track her, I couldn't predict her position, which meant I couldn't lock on for a long-range strike. Even if I forced a shot, she’d just dodge it.

"Thinking of tactics while the enemy is in front of you?"

She suddenly appeared behind me and delivered a kick to my stomach. I was sent flying, crashing through a small grove of trees and landing in the shallow water of the lake, stars dancing before my eyes.

"Get up."

She didn't give me a moment to breathe. Grabbing my green leafy cape, she threw me into the air and proceeded to pummel me from every direction at a speed the naked eye couldn't follow. Unlike me, parts of her body were alloyed; her strikes were incredibly painful. Combined with the five pairs of black and white wings on her back, she could strike from any angle—head, chest, waist, stomach, legs. Nowhere was safe.

She beat me as if I were a common thief, putting me through a miserable ordeal. For a long time, I was just a punching bag, unable to dodge, let alone strike back. The pain was the first thing to fade, which was a blessing when I hit the ground; even when she used her thighs to nearly snap my waist, I didn't cry out. I no longer had the strength to.

I lay discarded like refuse beneath the rotting roots, using **Fascination** to release pink gas and drain the life from the surrounding plants to repair my damaged body. Soon, I pushed myself up again, ready for more. This time, I’d hold out longer.

"Come on. Is that all? Are your hands tired? Do you need me to come over and massage them for you?"

My taunt earned me a fresh barrage of violence. This time, however, I noticed her movements were visibly slower than before. I also discovered a fatal flaw—her will was thin. Her psyche was brittle, shattering under the slightest pressure. Her heart wasn't strong; she lacked conviction. To put it in personal terms, she wasn't "tough." She had spent her life being swayed by others, with no agency of her own.

Such a person was pitiable, yet also hateful. Pitiable because she wanted to escape her current life and become strong, yet lacked the ability to do so. Hateful because she constantly sought to prove herself, even at the cost of hurting others. She rarely gave a direct response to her own beliefs—not because she didn't want to, but because she didn't dare to. She refused to acknowledge her own weakness, just as she refused to acknowledge the strength of others. In the end, even if she lost, she wouldn't understand *why*.

I gambled everything. Panting, I told her, "It’s exhausting, isn't it? Living in your sister's shadow."

"What did you say?"

Her fist stopped inches from my face. I could see the hesitation in her eyes. This was it. You wanted to inspect me? Well, let me give *you* a lesson.

"Don't play dumb. Adam told me everything."

I faced her with feigned calmness. Inside, I was a wreck; I had no idea how to actually beat the "outer" Heron, so I had to target the "inner" one.

"The weak older sister, the strong younger sister. Usually, it’s the other way around. I don't know why you two were different. The one who was supposed to be protected by her sister ended up being the one who protected her at the critical moment. That kind of trauma is hard to heal. Burdened by your guilt, you can't face her or her Digimon. That's why you had so many chances but wouldn't use 'Holy Hope' to finish me. Instead, you kept using LadyDevimon's close-combat style, trying to make me feel as 'desperate' as you are. Well, I have news for you: it won't work."

Because I am far stronger than you.

"You... you... I didn't... I’m not! You... I..."

A few short sentences had thrown her into total disarray. She could only stammer, her lips moving but no coherent words coming out. It was no wonder Owl had made someone of her caliber a **Reserve**. To put it bluntly, with her current lack of conviction, she wouldn't be fit for any of the other four positions, no matter how many years she trained, how many masters she sparred with, or how much experience she gained.

"Stop being so self-righteous!" she finally managed a complete sentence. "I’m the one inspecting your progress, not the other way around! Know your place!"

Oh, I knew my place. I was the master now, and she was about to be defeated in the very thing she took pride in. She would surely be confused; she would surely ask "Why?" And I would be there to answer: *Because you are weak, and I am strong. You were destined to lose to me today. Many things in this world happen without a reason. Reality is reality, inside or outside. Don't think that because you're in a digital space with a new skin, you can escape anything. Brutal reality will chase you to every corner of the world. Start thinking about where you'll go next, so I can send you on your way...*

Hundreds of rose petals flurried down. She hadn't even realized she had lost yet, still living in her self-created world called "Escape."

She looked on the verge of a breakdown. Fortunately, I was about to end it.

I skipped the process and went straight to the conclusion—I unleashed the forbidden blooming, **Forbidden Temptation**, and defeated the lost and broken Heron. I sent her **Mastemon** flying toward the small island in the center of the lake. It was secluded enough; no one would disturb her while she cooled down and reflected.

If you gave it even a modicum of thought, you’d know that Data beats Vaccine. She had been fighting me with only half her strength the entire time. As long as I could find the opening for my move, I wouldn't lose.

Back at the **Drink a Glass Bar**, Owl, Falcon, and Dove were waiting.

"Owl, I won."

"Beautiful. I knew you could do it." He gestured for me to sit beside him. "Have a drink. A small celebration. Don't worry, my treat. Welcome officially as the **Support****Free Birds**. After this, it’s time to head to the **Nature Court** to find your acquaintance."

"So soon?" I was startled. "Is their domain maintenance finished already?"

"It had to be," he explained. "A mission came in. It’s at the **Nature Court**, and the client is their Guild Master. Whether maintenance is done or not, we have to go. Let's just hope it isn't a dangerous job."

Even if it wasn't a formal "Raid," it was an opportunity. I could use this mission to see if I could actually coordinate with the team—and maybe earn some extra cash on the side.

I always gave him "face." "You're the Captain. You call the shots."

"And Heron...?"

"She’s 'facing a wall'!" I cut him off. "In short, I beat her, and she’s realized her own shortcomings. She’s probably staring at the lake right now, saying goodbye to her old self. Or, she’s still lost in a fog. It’s complicated. We can head out first; it’s best not to disturb her. Let’s give her some private space to clear her head."

I just hoped she wasn't a sore loser. Otherwise, I was in for a rough time.

"Halt! Who goes there!?"

### Chapter 6: The Chairman's Request

"Honored guests of your Chairman."

Owl explained our purpose on our behalf. One Piccolomon went inside to relay the message. Soon after, the **Lilimon** who came out with it received us and led us into this massive "data" garden.

"It seems even our **Free Birds** aren't known by everyone, huh?"

At these words, Dove couldn't help but chuckle. Falcon walked ahead, baring his teeth in a grin but offering no comment. Owl looked a bit embarrassed and quickly explained to me, "They are all the Chairman's servants, not players—genuine Digimon. You can't expect them to recognize you naturally."

Fine, I believed him. Or at least, I'd pretend I did.

The Chairman here goes by the name **Flower**, a 27-year-old from Singapore. She’s quite special; she never shows her true face in the Atrium system and always appears as **BanchoLilimon**. It’s said this is because she lacks confidence in her appearance—who knows if that’s true? In a garden draped with sprawling blooms, she had prepared floral tea, awaiting our arrival. Another person sat beside her—the one she had specifically notified.

"You didn't say you'd called someone else."

As usual, Owl went straight to the point, not mincing words with them.

From their conversation, I gathered they all knew each other, and their relationship seemed quite good, devoid of any stiff formalities. They spoke openly, laughing and joking. In fact, not just Owl, but Dove and Falcon also knew who the other person was.

"Mr. Heath is the President of the **Birdramon Commune**," Dove proactively introduced him to me. "A man with incredible social skills, naturally friendly, with friends all over the place. There's almost no one he doesn't get along with."

"You guys too?" I asked.

"Of course," Dove replied. "He's my savior. When I first entered the Atrium as a **Terriermon**, I loved wandering around the Digital World. Once, I accidentally fell off a cliff, unable to move, and was surrounded by a bunch of **Togemon****Birdramon** to rescue me."

His words were filled with respect for Mr. Heath, which left me quite touched.

To this day, Dove is deeply grateful for Mr. Heath's rescue. Even though he's not yet of drinking age, he still frequently runs over to Chairman Adam's place to treat Mr. Heath to a drink after a long day of patrolling, just to help him relax.

"Yo, little Dove, long time no see! You've been well?"

"You too, Mr. Heath," Dove smiled. "By the way, why are you here?"

"Chairman Flower invited two groups: yours and mine. The other little birds are circling in the sky; you can see them if you look up... well, they're flying a bit high, doesn't matter."

Simply put, he was here to help us.

"What is so important that you need two groups?" Owl voiced this question on our behalf.

Chairman Flower looked slightly troubled, appearing exhausted as she acted coy with the two men. The conversation that followed was quite explicit, completely mismatched with her cute face. Dove and I flushed red, not daring to listen too closely, while only Falcon appeared excited, thoroughly enjoying it.

Suddenly, he interrupted Chairman Flower, "Wait a second, it appeared in your bedroom? Don't tell me it wants to sleep... uh, no, it wants to share a bed with you?"

"That's not it," the Chairman shook her head. "It simply appeared... just like that, suddenly. You understand, right? One moment it wasn't there, the next it was."

The "it" they were referring to was the key target—or rather, the object—of this mission: **Belphemon: Sleep Mode**. It had mysteriously appeared in the Chairman's room, startling her into summoning the fairies in the garden and the guild members nearby. Together, after exhausting every possible method and using every ounce of strength, they finally managed to move it from her room to the garden.

"So, you want us to help you transport this lethal thing back to the Digital World and then eliminate it?"

"Exactly! Mr. Heath, you understand me so well..."

"Hardly." Mr. Heath sighed and turned his head toward Owl. "What do you say? You're already here. Care to lend a hand to a beautiful lady?"

Owl didn't answer immediately. Instead, he asked, "Do you have any idea how difficult this thing is to handle?"

"Of course," Mr. Heath said easily. "At least, I'm no match for it. Our **Birdramon Commune** can only help you transport it out. Whether it can be dealt with is up to you Mega-levels."

Hearing this, I couldn't help but interject, asking Chairman Flower, "Why didn't you call more people? They... don't seem very willing."

"None of them were willing, and I couldn't count on anyone else."

As she spoke, Flower scanned my body from head to toe, a satisfied smile appearing on her face. Then, before I could notice, she reached out and grabbed my waist, lunging into my chest. She buried her face in my bosom, rubbing against me while tearfully recounting her plight, "Waaah! I... I am a Chairman after all, and I asked so many people, but only you guys were willing to help me. I'm so moved, waaah, really moved... I wonder if you can help me..."

"That depends on whether our Captain agrees."

"Persuade him for me! Please! Please?

"I..."

I really couldn't stand her. This woman dared to openly grope me under this pretext, right in broad daylight. From my lower back all the way down to my rear, I was nearly rubbed to a sheen, and she still wouldn't let go, instead squeezing tighter and with more force. No matter how I struggled, she remained unmoved, clearly intending to take advantage of me from the start.

I have to admit, the **Nature Court** is truly "natural"—everything is so natural, so blatant. It was one thing for her to take liberties, but Falcon was benefiting too; he stared directly at us, not helping me at all, but watched with fascination as if he were learning techniques. Meanwhile, he kept providing cover for the Chairman, chiming in with supportive words so the others wouldn't pay attention to us. They were truly a pair made in heaven; it would be a pity if they didn't end up together.

"Owl, just agree," I suggested. "Looking at how pitiful the Chairman is, let's just help her."

As I spoke, Flower was continuing her exploration down my thighs. I grabbed her hand and forcefully pulled it away, then, with a hint of a sinister smile, I curved my knuckles and poked hard into her exposed navel. Coldly, I told her, "You'd better restrain yourself. That way, none of us lose face."

In other words, I was showing her: *This sister isn't a pushover!*

She slowly raised a hand in agreement. Since things were as they were, I didn't want to torment her further—I'd just assume she was jealous earlier. At most, I'd let her take advantage once; it's not my actual body anyway.

After some deliberation, Owl and Mr. Heath's opinions aligned: they decided to help.

"Th-thank you..."

Flower was clutching her stomach, her face looking none too good. Mr. Heath noticed and was quite puzzled, "What is with you? What happened? Did you eat something bad?"

She could only nod helplessly.

"Then it's settled."

Owl shifted the topic, turning his eyes toward Chairman Flower and bringing up another matter, "Is there a person named '**Snake**' here? Our newcomer is looking for her. If you can contact her, please make it convenient for us."

"Deal."

Flower raised a hand in an "OK" gesture. "The Lilimon who led you in will take you over. I'll contact Snake and ensure you meet her when you return."

Owl's move was executed flawlessly; I have to look at him in a new light now.

The sleeping Belphemon looked like a massive plush doll—black and round, with a pair of horns on its head and something resembling either ears or wings behind its head. It appeared unusually cute. Even so, it was not to be trifled with; just a single yawn could release a powerful shockwave.

According to the Lilimon, at first, Chairman Flower wanted to use her kick technique, **Petal Dance**, to move it out of the room, but she was met with its retaliation. Black flames, **Hinokagutsuchi**, were released from the chains wrapped around its body, not only burning half of the Chairman's calf but also incinerating several flower breeding rooms in a row. With a series of flower embryos destroyed, the Chairman, in a fit of rage, unleashed her ultimate technique, **Absolute Field**, swinging her yo-yo to slice through space, and used this spatial tunnel as a path to finally transfer it to the garden through a combined effort.

"You guys really didn't have it easy."

If it weren't for "it," the **Nature Court** wouldn't be having any "internal maintenance." These were all excuses made up on the spot to prevent any panic in the outside world.

"Why?" I was quite puzzled. "Isn't it usually better to spread the news as widely as possible so more people come to help?"

"That is Belphemon."

"So?"

"You're a Mega, so you aren't afraid. We're different," the Lilimon told me. "Take me for example; I am just a fairy-type Data-attribute. Meeting a Demon Lord-type Virus-attribute like Belphemon means only death."

I understood.

In other words, the reason everyone didn't come to help was simply because they were afraid of losing their lives. Thinking about it now, I might have been a bit impulsive just then. Owl and Mr. Heath too—they could have refused my suggestion or even ignored me altogether.

"Sigh, this is a tough battle," Falcon couldn't help but sigh. "Eliminating it isn't hard; everyone just needs to use their ultimates together to hit it. The problem is how to ensure it doesn't switch into **Rage Mode** after that."

"Is there a difference?"

"A huge one," Falcon slapped his face to steel himself and told me. "In Sleep Mode, it won't actively attack as long as we aren't too rough with it. But if it switches to Rage Mode... let's just say, at that point, you'll have to pray for yourself. Even my speed might not be enough to save you in time. Any Digimon that hasn't reached the Ultimate (Perfect) level will die instantly from data decomposition if hit by its roar; even Megas will be severely wounded, and some might even die."

His description was very grave, and Owl listened without offering any rebuttal. It showed that at least during this time, Falcon was no longer the man whose head was filled with perverted thoughts; he was also considering the team's future, trying to find a way to save as many as possible.

I walked to Owl's side, staring at the massive Demon Lord suspended in mid-air. I asked him, "What do you say, Captain? Are you confident in this 'Exploration'?"

I wasn't wrong; a **Direct Exploration** is also an exploration.

"Not at all," Owl shook his head and asked me, "Is it too late to regret now?"

"It's not," I stated seriously. "As long as you can swallow your pride and tell Chairman Flower to her face that you're afraid of death and so are we—we'd follow you away quite willingly."

He gave me a bitter smile, then reached out and patted my shoulder as he passed by me, while also reminding me, "Don't be careless. The opponent is strong. I'll leave the **Support** to you, Sakura. Don't die before we do."

That wasn't up to me; it was in the hands of fate.

Mr. Heath had already switched to his **Garudamon****Birdramon****Nature Court**, and then it would be completely sent out by a second group of members waiting at the Atrium Square. During this process, it would be best if anyone were willing to lend a hand; if not, they could only sacrifice a portion of the Birdramon as a price to transfer such a massive security hazard, preventing more people from losing their lives in vain.

### Chapter 7: The Resurrected Demon King

The transport operation continued, and everyone's nerves were taut, fearing a single slip-up in any part of the process.

"About to exit the **Nature Court** domain! Group two, get ready!"

Mr. Heath circled above the transported object, monitoring the overall situation from multiple angles. For now, everything was running smoothly, with no major issues—a stroke of luck amidst the misfortune.

The same was true for the **Free Birds**. I followed behind, keeping an eye on the suspended Belphemon while also observing the crowds below. Almost everyone had the same reaction—stopping to watch. Many likely didn't know what it was, much less what we were doing, treating it as some kind of parade. Those with a bit of knowledge quickly pulled their companions away, providing a lecture on exactly how dangerous this thing was.

"The Sin of Sloth, Belphemon."

This was a new term I heard. Where these Demon Lord-type Digimon came from, we didn't know; we only knew they were by no means roles that humans could easily play, and unless by chance, they were never easily encountered.

"Strange, isn't it?" Owl suddenly leaned in and said to me. "One of the **Seven Great Demon Lords**, Sloth itself, has descended upon the Atrium and hasn't been treated by the system as a BUG. This suggests that beneath that skin, there is likely a person just like us. Whether they are trapped inside waiting for rescue or biding their time to cause havoc once they wake up, no one can say for sure."

If that were true, then this matter was indeed suspicious.

"Could it be someone wanting to take revenge on Chairman Flower?"

"Who knows." Owl gave a cold laugh. "It's normal for someone who refuses to show their real face to be targeted. Then again, whoever wanted to retaliate against her is certainly capable..."

No kidding. To be able to quietly drop Belphemon into the Chairman's private room without leaving a trace—I couldn't think of any identity other than a network hacker. Stirring up trouble in reality and seeking revenge online—this kind of tactic was all too common in this day and age.

With the preamble finished, we quickly cut to the chase:

Once the transport team left the territory of the **Nature Court**, Belphemon suddenly stopped moving. It hung in the air as if caught in a BUG, remaining unmoved no matter how the Birdramon fire-wall pushed from behind.

"What's going on!?"

Everyone panicked, fearing it would switch forms at any second.

"Everyone stop, back away!" Mr. Heath immediately made deployments. "Transport group, standby on the spot! Maintain distance! **Free Birds**, clear the area, evacuate everyone nearby, quick!"

As the changes were carried out in an orderly fashion, Owl stepped forward on our behalf to inquire about the situation.

"Are there any changes?"

"None for now," Mr. Heath replied. "But there likely will be soon. We can't let our guard down."

"Do you need me to call in the analysis team?"

"You know them?" Mr. Heath looked puzzled. "Is that something only the official **Investigation Team** has access to... you kid, don't tell me?

"Yes," Owl admitted. "Who says the **Free Birds****Investigation Team**, we eat from the same bowl and belong to the same department. There's no distinction between 'official' and 'civilian'."

Mr. Heath capitulated with a heavy sigh. "Fine, bring them in. But make sure they stay safe."

"Don't worry."

With that, Owl turned his head slightly and gestured to Heath. "They're here."

"So fast!?"

"Just in case something went wrong during transport, I had them on standby nearby." Owl cracked his neck. "It's rare they get to be useful. Just stay aside and watch."

The Analysis Team was an elite cadre of Armor-level Digimon, all belonging to the **Armor Rebirth****Investigation Team**. Members came from all over the world and were generally experts in data analysis.

The team leader, **Magnamon**, led the way toward Belphemon. He first circled the target, confirming its appearance hadn't changed, then beckoned the five members behind him: **Halsemon**, **Shadramon**, **Quetzalmon**, **Flybeemon**, and **Togemogumon**. The six of them positioned themselves around Belphemon—front, back, left, right, top, and bottom—simultaneously using their Digimentals to perform a comprehensive analysis.

The analysis dragged on, tension thickening the air until a cold sweat slicked our palms.

When the analysis concluded, Magnamon approached Owl and Mr. Heath to report some bad news: "The data supply within Belphemon is insufficient. Unless someone sacrifices themselves to provide the nutrients it needs to move, no amount of **Birdramon** will ever make it budge."

Owl and Mr. Heath looked at each other and said simultaneously, "Then why was it possible before?"

"Because the space within the **Nature Court****Birdramon** combined with the air provided the conditions for Belphemon to move."

He explained it quite clearly—so clearly that it left the two in front of him confused.

Owl asked Heath, "Did you understand?"

Heath nodded. "Mostly. You?"

"Same."

Then Mr. Heath asked Magnamon, "So, in this situation, how can we make it move forward just a bit more without sacrificing our own people?"

Owl interjected, his voice cutting through the hesitation, "As you can see, we're inches away from the fire-wall, with only the Atrium Square in between. You can't just leave everyone who recently logged in facing a constant threat of death."

Magnamon listened and nodded silently, finding their words reasonable. After some careful thought and deduction, he finally proposed an extremely dangerous but effective method: "Find a way to wake it up, then draw its attention so it keeps chasing you, until you lead it into the Digital World."

"Be serious now," Mr. Heath's facial muscles twitched as he said, "How is that any different from suicide? Who would be tired enough of living to play like that?"

"It's not impossible."

Owl's words nearly made Mr. Heath's jaw drop. "No way! Are you crazy? If you want to die, you don't need to do it like this. What's the deal with taking others with you—scared of being lonely on the road to the underworld?"

"Unless you have a better idea?"

His counter-question immediately shut Mr. Heath's mouth.

Afterward, Owl told us about this risky plan and asked if we were willing to try it with him. Falcon and Dove naturally had no problem; they had walked with Owl for a long time and had done all sorts of life-and-death tasks for him. The situation primarily came down to me.

"Sakura, you decide."

"Ah... me? You're serious?"

"Don't forget the other role of the **Support**: helping the team make judgments."

He said it as if it were true. Where was this earlier? Shifting the blame to me at the critical moment—if that wasn't bullying a newcomer, I didn't know what was.

"Fine, I'll accompany you all to the bitter end."

I was forced to say these words, a mix of helplessness, regret, and a tiny bit of motivation—completely lacking in momentum. I felt like a lamb led to the slaughter, weak and pitiful, yet forced to mobilize everyone toward the knife.

"Aaaarrgh! I can't take it! Truly, I give in to you!" Mr. Heath was a bit frantic. "Risking my life with gentlemen! Since we're here, we might as well do something. Tell me, how do you plan to do it?"

"It's simple: just blast it."

With that, Owl swept his hand down. Dove immediately stepped forward, puffed out his chest, aimed at the sleeping Belphemon, and fired two **Giant Missiles** from his shoulders while activating all his cannons, launching a full-scale assault on Belphemon.

"It's no use, Captain!" Dove shouted back at Owl. "It needs more heat!"

"I'll go!"

"Get back here!"

Owl quickly stopped Falcon, who was about to rush in to help, and blocked him. He sent a massive **Dark Gaia Force** toward Belphemon. The resulting explosion was so immense that no one present could maintain their balance; those who could fly scattered, and those who couldn't fell to the ground. Before anyone could readjust, the sleeping Demon Lord had already awakened, brushing aside the smoke from the blast to reveal its other side?*Belphemon: Rage Mode**.

"I think we made it mad," Falcon said to me casually, drawing the large blade from his shoulder. The next second, he was bumped aside by Owl as Belphemon's claws came down, the resulting dust storm sweeping over us once again.

"?*Gold Solar Storm**!"

A brilliant golden laser cleared the crisis of our blocked vision; it was a gift from Magnamon.

"Quick! Drag it out before it reacts!"

"Understood!" Falcon was the first to respond. As a fellow golden comrade, his competitiveness was piqued—no matter what, he couldn't let them look down on him. A Mega had to be more useful than an Armor-level!

"Daring to sneak attack me? Let me see how much skill you really have!"

As Falcon spoke, he swung his **Yellow Beast Crescent Blade****Wolf-Beast Whirlwind**, delivering eternal pain to the newly awakened Belphemon.

The Demon Lord let out a howl of agony. Mr. Heath took the initiative, using **Shadow Wing****Extreme Jihad**. Golden light and crimson flames intertwined, and with the help of my **Rose Rapier**, we successfully forced the Demon Lord back.

"Don't stop?

Owl's voice pierced the sky. By the time it reached our ears, Belphemon had already swung its claws, wreathed in hellfire, delivering its **Dark Gift**. At the critical moment, a unique sound came from behind us:

"?*Hammer Boomerang**!"

Turning to look, a **Zudomon****Thor's Hammer**, knocking him to the ground.

"Seeing injustice on the road, I draw my blade to help!" He offered an explanation for his arrival and actions.

With such a brave warrior coming to help, how could we have any complaints? We all thanked him in our hearts. Once the hammer returned to his hand, he didn't stop. Holding the hammer with both hands, he swept it across the ground, creating sparks and lightning as he aimed for the chin of the rising Belphemon, swinging the heavy hammer upward.

"?*Hammer Spark**!"

The powerful force lifted Belphemon off its feet. Under the combined action of Garudamon's charge and Owl's **Black Warrior Tornado**, the awakened "Sloth" Demon Lord completely passed through that fire-wall, breaking free from the Atrium system and arriving in the Digital World.

"Let's finish it in one go!"

At Owl's command, no one held back their ultimate moves, each using their final techniques to strike Belphemon.

Falcon and Dove were on the outer perimeter, their **Twin Moon Crescent Slash****Burst Shot****Shadow Wing****Forbidden Temptation**—the double crimson strike—combined with the blinding light from **Plasma Shot****Hammer Spark****Hinokagutsuchi**, Owl quickly gathered a **Dark Gaia Force** formed from "negative thoughts" and completely ended it within the raging fires of the explosion.

"Whew, finally over."

"Not yet!"

Owl's words alerted everyone, causing us to snap back from our relaxed state to high alert.

Peering through the gradually dissipating smoke, that massive figure was still visible. It stood firm, without a hint of wavering, its chains already plunged into the ground, absorbing nutrients from the earth.

"It... it's getting bigger..."

Dove's shocked expression represented most of those present. No one had expected this Demon Lord to be so resilient; so many ultimate moves had been combined, yet they had seemingly achieved nothing.

Falcon also joined us to discuss a strategy: "Big brother, what now?"

"Find a way not to get hurt first?

Owl finished speaking and knocked Falcon out of the way, taking the Demon Lord's incoming chain head-on and flying back like a pinball, crashing into the nearby forest. I too had no time to react, watching as the Demon Lord's chain reached my face. In the crisis, Mr. Heath grabbed the chain with his talons, intending to pull it up, but the chain immediately became like a snake, wrapping around his ankle.

"Mr. Heath?

"Don't worry about me, get out of here!"

Next, he was dragged back by the Demon Lord using the chain and used as a flail. After being swung in a large circle in the sky, he was slammed directly onto Zudomon's body. Before he could catch his breath, he was snatched back again, taking a heavy punch from the Demon Lord and bouncing back onto Zudomon once more.

Looking elsewhere, Dove had also been tragically ensnared by the chains. Falcon was busy trying to sever them with his blade to rescue him, but after several attempts, he hadn't succeeded, unable to stop a curse from escaping his lips: "Damn it! Why is it so hard!?"

A flash of light suddenly erupted overhead. Looking up, Magnamon had tragically become Belphemon's target, with dozens of chains firmly binding him, making it difficult to release his **Extreme Jihad** to strike back. Black flames raced along the chains toward him, and soon, he disappeared into the explosion once again.

The word "total defeat" echoed in my mind for a long time, preventing me from moving my body as I should. I just stood there, staring—like a puppet or a brainless waste, helpless and powerless.

"Did we... just lose like this?" I couldn't help but ask myself.

Incinerated flower petals fell onto the back of my hand, bringing a slight sting that reminded me I hadn't turned into data yet—I was still alive. The roar of explosions overlapped; my legs felt weak as I slumped to the ground, taking a long breath as I prepared to accept fate's judgment.

"It's not over yet?

A fierce battle cry came from behind, like someone had slapped me awake. Looking back, a black-and-white angel emerged from the fire-wall, descending like a crane, bringing a glimmer of hope to the battlefield. With her swift speed, she fired an arrow of light, **Holy Hope**, from her right arm, hitting the Demon Lord's head. Then, using her left hand, she used **Dark Despair** to forcefully break off one of the horns atop the Demon Lord's head, turning the tide for us.

"Is the **Support** only at this level!?" she yelled at me fiercely. "Is this the 'strength' you boast of? It's enough to make one's sides split with laughter!"

The provocation worked perfectly, successfully awakening my fighting spirit.

"And what of it!?" I shouted back at her, refusing to back down. "You, a **Substitute**, only show up now? Were you waiting for me, the **Support**, to handle this alone? You bastard!"

The others likely didn't know what we were doing, but it didn't matter. Women's friendships can sometimes be expressed in strange ways; after all, we were both stubborn people who couldn't stand appearing weak in front of someone we disliked.

"Let's go together, Sakura!"

"Hah! Keep your eyes peeled, Crane!"

---

### Chapter 8: Mother's Testament

The battle with the Demon Lord of "Sloth," Belphemon, continued.

Crane's sudden assault proved effective; Belphemon was caught off guard, pinned to the ground and clutching half its face as it let out a howl of agony toward the sky. Seizing this window, Crane used **Dark Despair** again, severing the chains the Demon Lord had plunged into the ground, cutting off its energy supply. Without replenishment, it could not recover, and the Demon Lord's body could no longer withstand high-intensity damage. Facing the combined assault of the group once more, it became vulnerable and was quickly buried in the smoke of the explosions.

"Sakura, cover me!"

"Coming!"

Belphemon's massive shadow gradually emerged from the smoke. Sensing the opportunity was near, Crane and I exchanged a look, understanding each other's intent. I grabbed Crane's hand and was carried into the sky, then thrown forward. Using that momentum, I thrust the **Rose Rapier** head-on into the resurrected Demon Lord, successfully drawing all its attention.

Its face heavily damaged, Belphemon fell into a true rage, completely losing control. Before it could make a major move, I used **Thorn Whipping** to entwine its neck, restricting its actions, and told Crane in the sky, "It's all yours!"

"No need to tell me."

Crane spread her arms and controlled both hands, releasing her ultimate technique?*Chaos Degradation**. The "Angelic" right side gathered pale blue "Light" energy, while the "Demonic" left side gathered pale red "Dark" energy. Both were released at Belphemon simultaneously, merging to create a brilliant gateway. Immense energy erupted from it, and together with the surrounding environment, Belphemon was sucked inside, banished to the far side of a different dimension.

Jumping off the side of the Demon Lord's body, Crane grabbed my hand once more, catching me and carrying me away from the ripple effects of the dimensional gate. We soared through the sky in a brief moment of solitude.

"You 'Supported' very well."

She suddenly threw this line at me out of the blue, making my heart flutter a bit, though I suspected she might be speaking against her conscience.

"Feeling a bit reluctant?" I pouted and turned my face away, feeling somewhat petty. Peering at her reaction, though she didn't show it clearly, I could vaguely detect a flicker of annoyance on her face—she was likely being petty just like me. This only proved that we were both immature women.

The mission was a complete success—a victory for the **Free Birds**.

We thanked Magnamon and Zudomon for their help, bid them farewell, and then exchanged a few words with Mr. Heath, reflecting on the difficulty of the battle. Then, the group returned to the **Nature Court** to report.

This time, Chairman Flower was personally waiting at the entrance to welcome our triumphant return. Beside her, flanked by Lilimon and Piccolomon, was someone else—a human woman with exceptional proportions. She was very elegant, with an undeniable aura, looking perhaps slightly older than me. She wore a police uniform, appearing upright and charming.

Skipping past Chairman Flower's long-winded introduction, I'll get straight to the point: she was "Snake."

"Hinomoto Snake, nice to meet you."

I stepped forward to greet her, as she was the person I had been looking for. "Nice to meet you, Officer Hinomoto..."

"Ah, no need for such formalities," she replied with a sweet smile. "I'm not a police officer; I'm a fashion model. The Chairman said someone was looking for me urgently, so I came in during a break in a photoshoot and didn't have time to change. Please forgive any inconvenience."

Captain Owl orchestrated the operational handover.; I trusted them to accurately convey the news to Chairman Flower. As for me, it was time to settle a score with the woman in front of me.

I asked her point-blank, "Do you recognize me?"

"You are..." She studied my appearance, thinking for a long time before stating, "You look very much like an old friend of mine."

"Is her name Shimizu Iwami?"

I mentioned my mother's name. Hearing it, she immediately rushed forward and grabbed my arms, asking excitedly, "Yes, that's her! How... how is she? What happened? Why are you here instead?"

I laid the entire truth bare.

After listening to my account, she let out a long sigh and slumped onto the grass of the **Nature Court**. The fire in her gaze extinguished, replaced by a weight that dragged her expression into the abyss.—she looked like she had aged fifty years in an instant.

"She sent you to find me?"

"Not exactly," I stated truthfully. "I just wanted to see for myself what kind of person she lost to."

"Is it as simple as that?"

"As simple as that."

"Heh, heh." She gave a weak laugh and said to me, "You win, Sakura Mandai."

She called out my name, even though I hadn't told her.

Sensing my surprise, she revealed the truth. It turned out my mother, Ms. Shimizu Iwami, had known for a long time that she might encounter misfortune. Thus, she had made her testament in advance, arranging things for later—including transferring her account to my name and arranging for Snake to be my personal mentor, to help me familiarize myself with this world quickly, inherit her stature within it, and live as freely as she did.

"How 'free' was she?"

"The two of us were the elite of the **Nature Court**. The '**Twin Flowers**' referred to us."

The moment she mentioned "Twin Flowers," I understood. It was one of the four most famous duos among the guild's elite, along with the **Order of Holy Knights**' "Red and Blue," the **Raider Brigade**'s "Rainbow Starlight," and **Atlantis**'s "Amphibious Brothers," collectively known as the "Guild Quadrille." Their reputation was known throughout the entire Atrium system. I had previously come across an introduction to them in my mother's diary, but I never expected her to be one of the flowers.

"Wow, that's truly impressive," I complimented her insincerely. "So, she wanted you to be my mentor..."

What was this? Did she not trust her own daughter? Did she think I couldn't forge my own path? Or was she worried I'd be tricked in a strange world? I didn't think any of that was likely.

"If you're unwilling, I won't force you," she said in a negotiable tone. "She also told me that if we met for the first time and you were defiant, refusing to listen or trust me, I should go ahead and personally handle you—to let you experience that the cruelty of this world is no less than that of reality. Now, it seems that won't be necessary."

Of course not. Having defeated a Demon Lord, the **Free Birds** weren't about to be tied down by a snake. That said, Snake was still someone worth my trust, being an old acquaintance of my mother's; it wouldn't hurt to make a new friend.

I told her about my situation. After listening, she didn't seem surprised, but instead asked me, "So, have you found a way for you to return to reality yet?"

I shook my head, indicating we hadn't.

She didn't say much else, only expressing sympathy for my plight, and revealed to me, "Based on my deduction, Chairman Flower likely shares the same predicament as you, though she has her own concerns."

In other words, she didn't trust any "person," and even with her own servants, she remained guarded. This was likely why her garden was filled with Digimon.

"So, Chairman Flower has no friends?"

"Pretty much," Snake told me. "The closest relationship she has is with people like Heath. Other than that... there doesn't seem to be anyone else. She rarely initiates contact with others; it's always them coming to her."

"What was my mother's relationship like with the Chairman?"

"How should I put it..." Snake looked slightly troubled. "If I say it was good, it wasn't *that* good. If I say it was bad, they truly respected each other and showed each other a great deal of face. Oh, right, I forgot to tell you—the Chairman of the **Nature Court** is replaceable."

"Replaceable?"

It was the first I'd heard of it.

"Do you remember the agreement between me and your mother?"

"Of course," I said fluently. "Whoever evolved to Mega level first would be eligible to run for the next Chairman... Speaking of which, after so much time in the digital world, it's a bit strange that you haven't become Chairman yet, isn't it?"

Her face immediately turned sour, as if I had struck a nerve.

"Ah, that... actually, it's not 'strange',", she said sheepishly. "I've had the eligibility and even challenged the Chairman... but I've just never won, have I?"

"That really is..."

"But it doesn't matter!" She suddenly changed her tone, looking at me with expectant eyes. "Now there's you! If it's you, I think you won't be like me—overestimating your own strength and getting thrashed by the Chairman."

No, no, no, she thought too highly of me. If I went, the result would be the same, and likely worse. If you think about it simply, if I had that kind of ability, I wouldn't be hanging around with Owl and the others. Besides, if I had that kind of strength, how could I have been bullied that way by a pervert from the start?

Seeing my feigned modesty, she smiled and told me I wasn't being frank. I admitted as much—not only was I not frank, I was also a bit arrogant, conceited, and proud. Who could blame me? I was young.

Being young is an asset; no arguments accepted.

"How about we give it a try?" she suggested. "You and me, right here. Just a friendly match, what do you say?"

"A try it is."

Though Sakura Mandai wasn't an expert fighter, she wasn't one to back down from a challenge.

In this informal duel, there was no need for pre-battle chatter. Once we switched to our Digimon forms, we went straight to it. She was **Lotusmon**, I was **Rosemon**; one purple, one red. The result: one won, one lost. No need to guess—I was definitely the loser, without a doubt.

Through that brief clash, I discovered her strength was anything but ordinary. It was no exaggeration to say that within the **Free Birds**, aside from Owl, no one else was her match. Both in combat experience and nimble response, she far surpassed us. She truly deserved her place as the strongest in the guild, second only to the Chairman.

"You... you're incredible..."

I clutching my waist as she pulled me up from the ground, my face looking bitter as I asked for confirmation: "Did my mother... did she have this level of strength too?"

"You want my honest opinion?"

"Of course."

"She was stronger than me."

I suddenly felt a pang in my chest, a feeling I couldn't quite name.

"I hate to admit it, but it's the truth. She was better at solo combat, and in terms of physical stamina, she was far ahead of me. If she were still alive, the position of Chairman would be hers."

Coincidentally, I felt the same way.

Since she had admitted it herself, there was no need for me to dwell on it. Having completed the purpose of my visit, it was time to leave—yet I couldn't return, which was a kind of tragedy in itself.

Owl and the others rushed over after hearing the commotion. Seeing us safe and sound, having made peace and sitting together like sisters, they finally breathed a sigh of relief.

"You two... did you have to make such a scene..."

While Owl was walking over, Snake leaned into my ear and asked, "Is he your boyfriend?"

I denied her guess with absolute certainty: "No, he's my savior. He promised to help me find a way back to reality. I'm one of them now."

"Not bad. Taking down Belphemon right after joining—you have potential."

"Hardly. I'm still far behind you."

We smiled at each other, and then she said, "Young people shouldn't be so polite; it'll go to this senior's head! Hmm? Speaking of which, there was a request for me to serve as a bodyguard for a **Pukumon** and assist it in crossing the sea. I couldn't find where it was, so I've been putting it off..."

I felt this was purely an excuse, likely made up on the spot without a draft. To put it bluntly, she was using her senior status to dump the tasks from above onto us, calling it "mentorship" or "help." We were all women; who was she trying to fool?

"Speaking of which, Sakura, could you guys check it out for me?"

What did I say? As expected, more made-up reasons followed.

"I don't want them to have a bad impression of our **Nature Court** because of my personal reasons. I've already cleared it with the Chairman. Just think of it as a favor to your senior, okay?"

I wasn't the one to make that call; ask our Captain, he was right in front of you.

"Okay?"

I repeated it to Owl. He was stunned for a moment, then tilted his head and said to me, "Are you... being that... rash? Not even going to... discuss it with the team...?"

He was right; I was a member of the **Free Birds**, and I should prioritize the team's interests.

So I flatly refused her: "Senior Snake, as you can see, our Captain... and everyone else, seem quite reluctant. Besides, compared to yours, our strength is like children playing house. Could you perhaps find someone more capable?"

Normally, a senior who was thick-skinned enough to hear such a rejection would have backed off and withdrawn their unreasonable request. Snake did exactly that, leaving me with plenty of face—but another senior on the other side didn't seem to feel the same way.

"Don't go looking for anyone else."

Owl interrupted me just in time, stepping forward and whispering into my ear, "It's not every day a job walks in the door. Opportunities are for seizing; everything can be discussed."

With that, he turned back to Snake and began to persuade her: "Truly, wait for us a moment while we discuss our plans internally. We'll see if everyone has enough free time. If it's all good, it's no problem—the **Free Birds** are happy to serve you."

So this was what he meant by "discussing"? I have to say, Owl, I'm looking at you in a new light again.

As I said, he's the Captain, so he makes the calls; my opinion was just my own. I, of course, had no problem—I was always free. So while they were discussing, I asked Snake, "Senior, I just heard you mention crossing the sea... where are you going?"

"The aquatic guild, **Atlantis**."

"Is it for something special?"

"Not particularly," she said. "It's just a **Pukumon** who wants to go there to propose to someone. I don't know what he did before, but he's very unpopular there—they're ready to draw blades at a moment's notice. I felt sorry for him, so I took the request."

She truly was a kind person, completely unlike what her name suggested.

"Is it dangerous?"

"Depends on who you ask," Snake explained. "Pukumon is a Virus-type, and he's most afraid of the 'Vaccines' in the water making trouble and ruining his chances. This senior is only one person and can't swim, so my heart is willing but my strength is lacking."

I'd had enough of her excuses—it was beyond reason. At the same time, I found it hard to understand what benefit she got from being so transparently petty and calculating. I only hoped this wouldn't be another life-risking mission, or the **Free Birds** would have to risk it all again to fly free and find the meaning of survival.

### Gaiden 2: Abnormal Party Crusade

## (I)

### -By Red-

I am Red. My real name is Red; I despise fictional names.

In the Atrium system, every guild has its own elite frontrunners. Their strength isn't necessarily the highest, but the roles they play are certainly the most vital, second only to the guild's Chairman. In the **Order of Holy Knights**, this position is occupied by us, the "**Red and Blue**" duo. The other guy is Blue—don't worry, he'll show up in the next part to say hello.

Some people think our personalities are mismatched. I don't blame them; you can see it just from our names. Furthermore, I am the Regional Operations Director for Coca-Cola, while he is the Regional Operations Manager for the competitor, Pepsi. I won't disclose exactly which regions. If someone said we were as close as brothers during our daily lives, almost no one would believe them.

The relationship we present to others is that of partners, friends, rivals, and market competitors. Thus, the missions we receive are also bound together, as the Chairman says it's "safer" that way. As if I didn't know—he actually does it to save on paying a second person for a job that requires two. If we couldn't even figure that out, we might as well quit being regional operations directors and go back to drinking a bottle of Coke.

That day, I had just reached my office, and my seat wasn't even warm yet, when I received a barrage of frantic messages from the Guild Chairman. One after another, the content of each message was basically the same: urging me to log on and take a job.

I asked him, "Don't you have anything else to do all day? Don't you need a life?"

He answered me point-blank, "What could a fishing enthusiast have to do? Every day I set up my rod and log on. My wife watches it for me, and when I come back, I even get to eat grilled fish..."

If you're going to talk, talk. Why suddenly brag in the middle of it? What's so great about having a wife?

I frowned and told him, "Tell me what it's about first. I'll see if I can make some time to evaporate from the human world for a bit."

"You know about the **Abnormal Party**, right?"

"What party?"

I was sure I hadn't misheard.

"Abnormal. You didn't mishear—abnormal. As the name suggests, it's a club formed by 'abnormals.' The club leader is a notorious 'Lust' rogue, a siren of vice. She loves taking her group of 'abnormals' into the Digital World to harass anyone with a decent appearance, acting as stalkers and flashers. Their targets are always people with a hint of sexiness. Apparently, they've been making quite a stir lately, and the higher-ups told me to send someone to clean them up. So I found you. Consider it handled."

Of course there was a problem.

I wasn't polite with him either and asked directly, "Where do you get the confidence that our 'Red and Blue' duo can handle this?"

"Well, you are the guild's representatives. If not you, then who else?"

"Why don't you go yourself?"

He laughed a few times and stated calmly, "If I go, who's going to manage the guild's affairs? Think about it—I even offloaded a mission to transport Belphemon to another guild. Do you think I'd have time to deal with a third-rate club? Wake up; I'm not that free."

So that Belphemon matter was his doing.

I knew it. How could a sleeping Demon Lord-type Digimon appear in the **Nature Court**'s territory for no reason? Someone definitely offloaded it on purpose. Passing the troubles assigned from above to others—that's his usual style. I'd long since ceased to be surprised by it.

"How long will this take, roughly?"

"For you two, I estimate no more than two days (two minutes). By the way, I've already notified Blue. He'll be waiting for you at the rendezvous point. I'll send you the specific coordinates later. I wish you a swift resolution and a triumphant return. That is all."

The messages from his end stopped. I hadn't even said I was free. Dammit, played again. Now I'd have to find a chance to take my equipment to the restroom.

I made sure the restroom door was locked from the inside and clicked on the left to successfully log in.

After passing through the Atrium public area and reaching the fire-wall, I looked up and saw a **Garudamon****Heath**, my drinking buddy and the president of the **Birdramon Commune**. He spends all day leading a bunch of **Birdramon** on patrols in the Digital World. He rescues people in distress and helps Digimon in danger. In short, he carries out the concept of "chivalry" to the end, and he has the best reputation in the entire Atrium system.

"Yo, look who it is—the daring truant Red."

He walked over and high-fived me, then gave my rear a smack. "Next time, you're buying the drinks. Pay back the money you owe me from last time! The boss recently hired a new bartender; I want the most expensive one!"

"Whatever you want, but I'm only ordering one glass."

Equal to a 330ml volume, a single glass of the cheapest wine in the entire bar costs more than twenty-three cans of Coca-Cola. It's hard not to admit that Chairman Adam is a shark.

After parting ways with him, I rushed to the designated location to meet up with Blue. When I arrived, I found he had already taken the form of **UlforceV-dramon****Abnormal Party**'s venue (stronghold), enjoying himself thoroughly. Specifically, he was sweeping up all the **Etemon****Ulforce Saber****Kinkakumon****Ginkakumon****Shining V-Force****WaruMonzaemon** he had knocked out earlier.

"?*Final Elysion**!"

I purged the **Gryzmon****Gerbemon****Poop Bazookas** at him.

"You're late."

He greeted me with that trademark disdain, as if my very existence was a debt unpaid.

I told him helplessly, "I have to control the time I spend in the restroom so a cleaner doesn't find the stall empty but still locked from the inside and think it's haunted."

"Do you usually squat or sit?"

"Don't talk nonsense; toilets were invented to be sat on... You squat?"

"Yeah. My legs get numb if I squat too long."

"Ha, same if you sit too long."

The topic suddenly took a strange turn, but fortunately, we both realized it at the same time.

Following the dilapidated castle all the way deep inside, we encountered **Devidramon**—killed them. We met **Phantomon**—killed them. We met **Nanimon**—still killed them. You ask why there are no details? I'll tell you: a **Vanguard** doesn't need a process, only a result. Because the process lasts only a split second—too fast to describe in words.

Along the way, we saw many people who had been kidnapped by these abnormals and brought here. There were men and women, all given new appearances. Seeing "suggestive" outfits on Digimon felt more than a little jarring.

He reminded me, "Focus. Don't let your eyes wander."

I was speechless. "Didn't you look too? And so closely... Hey, I'm talking to you, give me a response."

See? This guy is narrow-minded and extremely hypocritical. Let me give a simple example: when going to the cinema to watch a movie, you usually buy popcorn and a drink at the counter. The price is usually a bit higher than what's sold outside. If the drink he buys is under the Coca-Cola company, he'll be miserable all day. Conversely, if it's from Pepsi, he thinks it's worth it no matter how expensive. So I feel like sometimes he just targets me on purpose—no reason, no purpose, just to vent, for the thrill of it.

Coming to a fork in the path further ahead, it split into two directions: one going up, leading directly to the castle's rooftop, and one going down, leading to the castle's dungeon. He had wings, so he naturally went up. I couldn't fly, so I automatically went down. Throughout the entire process, there was no verbal exchange—that's what you call a silent understanding.

The pitch-black underground space was vast and slippery, so I slowed down my pace. Soon, I discovered a figure hiding in the darkness—he wore a crown on his head and wrapped his body in a cape. He appeared to be a **KingEtemon**. Something was glowing behind his cape, flashing rhythmically, and he was humming a strange melody as if preparing something. Every now and then, he would chuckle to himself, letting out a few sinister laughs that made one's spine tingle.

I asked him, "What are you alone in there laughing about?"

"Hee hee hee," he chuckled. "Preparing a meeting gift for you."

With that, he suddenly threw open his cape, and subsequently, the entire underground illuminated with colored lights he had pre-arranged. The scene was entirely like a party venue; he was the host, and I was the only guest.

"Let us welcome today's VIP with a warm round of applause: Dukemon?"

He showed off the character for "Great King" on his chest. Accompanied by music that sounded like noise, the atmosphere failed to heat up at all, perhaps due to my cold indifference. Affected by this, he became less calm, gritting his teeth in frustration and casually sending out a gift tailored for me—his ultimate move.

"?*Photon Blocker**!"

The glowing sphere hit my shield, and absolutely nothing happened. The scene instantly became very awkward.

At this, I huffed coldly and said, "Is that it?"

He then extended a finger and wagged it in front of my eyes. "NO, NO, NO. This is just the foreplay. The good stuff is yet to come. For example... hee hee... see the environment here? There's a breach!?*King Monkey Kick**!"

Taking a step to the left and holding up my shield, I smoothly and easily avoided it.

"Ah... this..."

Dammit, how did I let him speak first this time? This shouldn't be happening.

In front of him, I offered my mockery, asking, "Don't you have that kind of extremely powerful skill that can stir up a person's tension and make them deal with you seriously?"

He pretended to think for a moment and then answered, "I do. For example, now..."

He bared his teeth at me, and still, absolutely nothing happened. Never mind him; even I felt embarrassed for him. If there were a crack in the ground right now, I guarantee the first one to dive into it wouldn't be him, but me.

What a joke.

"Ah, I've had enough!" I, the competent audience member, couldn't help but complain. "You waste, '**performing a monkey show**' is for you to play others, not for you to act as the monkey yourself and play with yourself. Go to hell!"

Thrusting out the lance in my right hand, I initiated **Royal Saber**. He stood there, not even dodging, and obediently let me pierce his chest. He turned into a mass of data residue and vanished forever from this world.

So, what exactly was I expecting?

### -By Blue-

I am Blue. I'm direct.
The Boss (He) wants me to crusade against the **Abnormal Party**. I'll go.

I walked into the company's data server room, swiped my card to enter, turned around to close the door, and made sure it was locked from the inside. I took the equipment out of my backpack and plugged it in, then clicked the button on the left to login to the Atrium system.

Passing through the fire-wall and arriving at the rendezvous point, I imagined myself as a wooden post, standing in front of the castle gate for nearly two hours. The red guy never showed up. During that time, three groups of people entered the castle, each with a bountiful harvest. The prey they caught were all humanoid living Digimon, with a balanced ratio of males and females, all with quite good figures.

At first, I was even thinking: *don't these guys get tired of eating this stuff all day?* Then a **Nanomon** came over to pick a fight with me: "Hey, you! Who are you!? Private property, no trespassing!"

"I'm waiting for someone."

"Waiting? For who? Do I know them?"

"Probably not," I answered honestly. "He should be here any second. When you see him, you'll know if you recognize him."

Later, he harassed me for a while, insisting I leave. He didn't think about how that could be possible—the mission wasn't finished, the other teammate hadn't arrived, and he wanted me to go away? No way.

"I see you're refusing a toast only to drink a forfeit..."

I found him annoying, so I drew the sword from my bracelet and gave a light swing. He was cut into two pieces and vanished with the wind as ash.

"Whew, finally some peace and quiet."

Hardly had I spoken when someone happened to come out of the castle and witnessed this scene, standing there stunned. I turned my head and looked carefully; it was an **Insekimon**.

Seeing his resemblance to **Gotsumon**, I called out to him and asked, "What's your relation to Gotsumon?"

"I don't know!" He shuddered, then turned back, pushed open the castle gate, and ran inside at full speed, screaming as he went: "Nanomon is dead! Someone come quick—someone's looking for trouble at the door!"

Afterward, a group of **Myotismon****Volcamon** burst out of the castle, one by one looking aggressive, saying they were going to skin me and smash my armor to avenge their comrades. I was deeply moved by the camaraderie they displayed, so I held back a bit and didn't use my best speed. Yet they still died—it was quite ridiculous.

"What's going on?" I was puzzled on the spot. "Why is everyone targeting me today? Looks like I'll have to let that guy share some of the burden later. Good, it's decided."

After a while, the Guild Boss connected with me and asked, "Blue, I just caught a glimpse of your location. What are you doing standing in front of that castle gate alone?"

"Waiting for Red."

"You're in the wrong place."

"The location you gave me is here; it's correct."

"Yes, the location is there, but—that's the enemy's stronghold."

Holy crap! I knew there was a reason they were all targeting me—it turned out I had exposed myself. My bad, my bad.

In case he couldn't find me later, I asked the Boss about the situation: "Why hasn't Red arrived yet?"

"I just got in touch with him. He should be there any second. Wait a bit longer."

"No," I told him. "I have things to do."

"What things?"

"Purging."

With that, I raised the light sword in my hand, sliced open the castle gate, and drifted inside, starting an indiscriminate massacre of the inhabitants.

No one was innocent. No one could leave alive to tell this tale—especially not to Red. No one. As for the Boss, he's the type to forget once he's said it, and besides, it's not a big matter; he won't take it to heart. So there was no need to worry—it's never too late to kill after speaking out.

Then, what happened in the previous part occurred. Red went to the dungeon, and I went to the rooftop.

The path to the rooftop was clear. Arriving at a bell tower, a **Piemon** suddenly hopped out, balancing on a ball and moving nimbly, showing off his exquisite balance.

"Do you want to die?" I asked him.

"I don't," he answered unhurriedly.

"Then get off that thing. Stop dancing around in front of me."

Saying this, I kicked his ball away. He made a powerful leap, flipping over my head and casually throwing down a white cloth, just big enough to cover my body.

He naively thought I would do nothing, just stand there and let the cloth cover me, then turn into a keychain hanging at his waist. Of course I wouldn't let him succeed, and it was hard for him anyway, because I had already activated **Ulforce**. That cloth's falling speed in my eyes was comparable to a snail on the ground—the time was ridiculously long. I even had time to pinch the four corners and re-fold it into a new shape, then place it under his feet as a stepping stone before he landed. Afterward, I ran back to my original spot, making him think I had been stationary all along.

"You?

Seeing that I hadn't disappeared and that the cloth, now folded into a flower shape, was under his feet, the look on his contorted face was beyond hilarious.

"The clown is always the one being played," I told him. "If you want to cry, just cry. I'll wipe your tears for you."

"Aaaarrgh?"

He was furious. He drew the four swords from his back and threw them at me.

"?*Trump Sword**!"

Similarly, the speed of the four swords was very slow—slow enough that his juggling couldn't be fully utilized. He originally wanted to make it impossible for me to find the correct direction they were coming from, but to me, their disappearance was just them turning transparent.

If I were to expose his trick to his face, he might cry himself to death, so I made preparations in advance. I kindly picked up that cloth from earlier, wiped all four swords clean, and then tied the four corners of the cloth to the hilts of the four swords. I moved the whole assembly directly above his head, allowing it to drop. As it fell, I raised the sword in my hand, sliced through his waist, and sent him on his final journey.

After resolving it, Red rushed up from below to meet me. He told me it was strange—KingEtemon had done absolutely nothing and just stood there frozen. He had just charged in with his lance and finished the guy.

I thought about it and asked him, "Don't you know there's something called network latency?"

"I know, but dammit, that was too slow!"

"It's not that he was slow; it's that our network is too good."

"Fair enough."

"Pepsi's network department has always been reliable."

"Our Coke's isn't bad either."

Then we both put on a face that said we wanted to kill each other, but aimed our weapons behind us. There was a bitch trying to sneak attack us from behind, but unfortunately, we had noticed her long ago.

"Just like the intelligence said," Red raised his voice on purpose. "The club leader of the **Abnormal Party**, **Lilithmon**, an alluring tramp."

"Hahaha," she let out a laugh at both of us like a maniac. "Calling me alluring, hmm... I admit it. After all, a person is beautiful like this all their life. Calling me a tramp, hmm... you're the tramp! Your whole family are tramps!"

Her sudden change of face caught us off guard.

Red sighed and leaned in close to me without an expression, asking, "We both just got insulted by a tramp. I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now. What do you say?"

What else could be done? The old way.

"As if I'm comfortable," I told Red. "Say no more. Beat her."

We agreed instantly, but the next second, the opponent immediately chickened out.

"Wait, you... don't come over yet!"

Too late. My fist had already swung out and had already touched her face. Her feet were off the ground, and she'd likely fall from the rooftop platform to the ground in a few seconds. If she was lucky, her face wouldn't be ruined.

"What are you in such a hurry for?" Red asked me helplessly. "The new drink reception at the **Drink a Glass Bar** doesn't start for another seven hours. Going now, you won't even get a seat. Just give up."

What? The new drink reception is today? How could I be so uninformed?

"The old rule," he suggested. "Whoever takes her down last doesn't pay tonight; the other one treats."

"Then I'd better hurry."

"Don't worry, I haven't called start yet. Three, two, one... Start!"

What's the difference? I'm already ahead!

"DO—NOT—ACTIVATE—ULFORCE?

The time it took him to say those words was too long—long enough for me to vault over the castle wall first, spread my wings and fly down, reaching Lilithmon's side. First, I cut off her right **Nazar Nail** that could corrode anything, then I tied her wings in a knot, helped her tidy her messy hair, and finally moved her over the nearby lake, waiting for her to fall into the water.

After waiting by the lake for a while, I finally saw Red.

"Yo, you're here."

"Why did you run so fast?" he said, panting. "Where is she?"

I turned my head and glanced at the bubbling lake surface. "Bathing. No peeking."

"And yet you're looking?"

"I have a taste for it."

"No way," his eyes widened. "You like her type?"

I nodded and told him, "Everyone has their hobbies."

"Eww... hobbies. I'd say 'abnormal' is more like it."

"An abnormal resolving an abnormal—I'd say it's just right."

"Fair enough." He leaned against a tree and asked me, "When do you plan to save her?"

"Not saving her."

"Why? Didn't you just say you like her? Turning your back so soon?"

"Not that." I answered him. "I just accidentally let my 'abnormal' side out. I wanted to see if a Digimon can drown in water. Look, she's still struggling, but she's almost..."

The words had hardly left my mouth when suddenly, an **Ouryumon** burst out of the lake, swallowed her whole, and then dived back to the bottom with satisfaction. Before leaving, it even turned toward us and let out a burp like a clap of thunder, thanking us for the feeding.

"This?

"This... is it over?"

We said it in unison. Neither of us gave the other a reply; we just stood there, staring at the lake surface, hoping to see a flower bloom or something. After a while, Red broke the silence:

"I don't know why, but I suddenly feel like drinking."

I cast a vote of approval. "Old place, old specifications?"

"Let's go!"

We agreed once more and turned toward the **Drink a Glass Bar**. After greeting Red's old friend Heath and exchanging a few words, we learned there were no seats left. We had to find two empty barrels from the warehouse in the back to sit on.

"What'll the two **Vanguards** have today?"

The boss greeted us warmly and recommended we try the new style mixed by the new bartender. For no other reason than that the drink mixed by the newcomer wasn't very expensive, and I'd been drinking the old specification for a long time anyway—it was time for a change of flavor.

"Here it is: the latest style, the 'Super Big Crayon'. Remember to stir it before drinking for a better taste. Enjoy."

It was a relatively expensive drink, with a slightly deep color—between brown and orange-red. It looked like coffee but wasn't coffee; it was bubbling inside, and the taste was very familiar.

"Don't you think..."

"Yeah, I have the same feeling."

A silent understanding is what builds rapport.

I asked the boss, "Excuse me, what are the ingredients for this drink?"

He answered with a single word that instantly unsettled us both.

"Cola."

"WHAT BRAND!?"

We both asked this question very loudly, making the noisy bar go silent for two or three seconds before it resumed its normalcy. Adding a few laughs to the rowdy crowd was exactly what we should do.

"You guys... seriously."

The boss leaned in with a look like he was concerned for idiots and told us grumpily, "Dr. Pepper. What, you have a problem?"

No problem. Just felt a bit of a pity. We both felt that way. Between "Red and Blue," there was never a need for verbal communication; everything was understood without words.

### Side Story III: Deep Danger Situation

### Part 1: The Raiders' Origins

#### Zero's Account (Part 1)

I do not know who I am, nor where I came from. I only know one name: Zero.

The United States federal government bestowed this title upon me. They raised me from a small child to be a network spy, tasked with handling various incidents that threatened national network security. I never disappointed them—not once. Every mission was completed flawlessly, leaving them with nothing to criticize.

Perhaps as a reward, or perhaps to discard me and make way for the younger generation, after I completed my stage-based education, they arranged for me to live in an apartment near the Pentagon and let me work with the Department of Defense.

From that day on, I followed my new superior—Zachary Lopez, a man with a distinct aura of mystery. After resigning from the CIA, he was transferred to the Department of Defense to continue his old trade. It was he who received high-level orders and arranged for an elite network spy like me to represent the United States in the **Raiders** to report to him.

"The Chinese representative's pet (Xiao Wang)—you are watching over (monitoring) it, correct?"

"Correct, sir."

During this past period, to prevent me from privately contacting her pet and harming or disadvantaging her, Dragon had specially created a security measure—moving her pet to a new residence, a natural volcanic lake. The place was remote and unvisited, indeed suitable for concealment. However, her pet didn't like it much there, feeling the water was too hot and uncomfortable, and the terrain was high. Every time she couldn't see Dragon going out on missions with us, her overwhelming longing drove her to sneak back to her original residence behind Dragon's back.

"If I remember correctly, that lake is a dead-water pool without a single fish left. Recently, her master has been busy Raiding in the depths. Don't tell me... you've been feeding her?"

In response to his speculation, I simply smiled slightly. "I have no such obligation, sir."

Later, I also explained to him that there had never been fish in the lake. She was always hungry, and at most, she could only dive to the lakebed to scavenge a few small shrimp to fill the gaps in her teeth. I wouldn't feel sorry for her or lend a helping hand, because I am not a person with a "humanitarian" spirit. Originally, I wanted to let her starve to death so I wouldn't have to act. No act means no trace, no trace means Dragon wouldn't find out, and if he didn't find out, he wouldn't suspect me. Of course, he might take his anger out on me because only I knew he kept such a large pet, but that didn't matter—at worst, I'd fight him to the death. If he lost a beloved one and gained a major grievance, I could learn more about one of his weaknesses. This would be advantageous for me and very advantageous for the United States of America. Aside from anything else, at the level of network strategy, we would have a greater advantage over the nation across the ocean. Isn't what we've been doing all for this?

"You have a great sense of awareness, Zero. You know, I'm starting to think more and more highly of you."

"Thank you for your praise, sir. This is only my duty."

"Continue."

The outcome defied prediction; the man possessed the devil's own luck. For some unknown reason, the "Demon Lord of Lust," Lilithmon, appeared on the lake surface without any warning. Lurking in the abyssal depths... mistaking movement for prey, she surged upward with mindless gluttony, her maw gaping to consume. She swallowed him whole, denying him the dignity of being chewed. It was fortunate she was a Vaccine-type; had she been a Data-type, those data bits would surely have been infected the moment they went down.

"So, she ate a Demon Lord and obtained a portion of her data..."

Actually, it wasn't just a portion; strictly speaking, it was all of it.

I didn't tell him this directly—not because I was afraid of him getting angry, but because I feared he wouldn't be able to handle it and would reach a level of rage that would cause him to drop dead in the network world, leaving not even a corpse behind.

To keep him alive, I could only try to steer the conversation elsewhere, telling him about the situation of the "Leviamon Subjugation War" **Raid**. First was Yu of the **Vanguard Position**; BanchoStingmon couldn't utilize a vanguard's full potential in the water at all and was badly beaten by the "Demon Lord of Envy," losing half his wings. If not for Lana of the **Support Position****Defense Position**; the mechanical GrandLocomon had difficulty functioning in the deep sea and could only stay in place and take hits, thus finding it hard to escape the fate of being scrapped. Fortunately, his armor was thick enough that the Digicore wasn't damaged, so he didn't perish under Leviamon's massive jaws.

"Dispense with the trivialities.," Zachary said, his patience always thin. "Tell me about your performance as the **Main Attacker Position**, or let's talk about our old friend, that **Substitute Position** who steals the show every time..."

In summary, the **Substitute Position****Main Attacker Position****Vanguard**, **Support**, and **Defense** were all offline, stepping forward to control the situation—grabbing Leviamon's jaw, curbing its struggles again and again, dragging it out of the water, and sending it into the sky. The latter could make clear judgments, ensuring the former had enough ability to send the target into a position advantageous for his finishing move, emerging from the sea surface ahead of time to make full preparations—first applying all-around suppression with the "Sword Spirits", then dealing the finishing blow with "Aus Generieren".

"So, for once in the United Nations Security Council **Raiders**, the one in the spotlight wasn't that **Substitute Position**, but you, the **Main Attacker**?"

Though it sounded harsh, it was the truth.

"Quite rare, isn't it?"

"Yes, indeed quite rare."

As he spoke, he calmed down, paused for two or three seconds, and then told me: "To tell you the truth, calling you to this "Zero Domain" wasn't just for you to report on your work. It was mainly to see if you could come over, if you were alive, and if you could log out and return to the real world, come to my office, and see the Minister with me. He has business with you."

Evidently, I happened to be free.

"When?" I asked.

"Anytime," he stated. "If I were you, I'd come after lunch, lest you go onto the battlefield with an empty stomach and the enemy (the Minister) hears your belly growl. Then, your face wouldn't be the only one losing credibility; my face would too."

*I can handle it.*

That was what I really wanted to say. Unfortunately, before I opened my mouth, I remembered a warning from my master: *You are a warrior, not a clown. Think before you speak, and know what should and shouldn't be said—especially in front of your commanding officer.*

Indeed, I have a master too.

I am also human, with my own passions and what one would call feelings. My time isn't entirely occupied by the **Raiders** and the United States of America; I also have private time for learning and enlightenment.

My master is Gankoomon, a fate that was sealed from the moment I initially chose the body of Huckmon.

He came to find me first. At our first meeting, like an old father who had been away for many years, he stood with a stern face and congratulated me on choosing his clumsy disciple's body. I told him then that I wasn't his disciple, but merely a pawn of the US federal government doing their bidding, needing to borrow his disciple's body for a while, and hoped he would be broad-minded and give me this chance. He said it didn't matter; he only recognized the body of Huckmon anyway. As for who was controlling it inside, he didn't care, didn't want to care, and was even less willing to care. His attitude toward this was quite "Obstinate", making it impossible to refuse.

His training was extremely strict, reaching a level of harshness—otherwise, it wouldn't have been possible for me to evolve from a Rookie so quickly and rise all the way to a Mega. For example, he was always followed by a pair of Sistermon sisters, both wearing nun's caps—Sistermon Noir and Sistermon Blanc. They looked like two cute mascots, but both were fierce. They would use me as a target for practice. I could block, dodge, or counter-attack, but everything had to be "stop-at-contact"; I couldn't let my sword tip touch them even an inch, because if it did, they would surely die.

With Gankoomon watching, those two sisters were safe. There were several times when it seemed my sword would strike them and I couldn't pull back. Master Gankoomon would appear beneath my sword in an instant, blocking the fatal blow for them, and then he would surely settle the score with me. In the unluckiest cases, I would take a hit from his "Iron Fist Punishment". He called this "Defense Training" for me, intended to hone my resilience. It left me in a pathetic state every time, but fortunately, I persevered tenaciously and didn't get beaten to death.

Occasionally, he would go out with me to complete free-exploration missions sent by higher-ups. We treated these as combat trials and developed a very strong rapport—a master-disciple duo, invincible.

He rarely acknowledged the strong, because in his eyes, there were probably only a few in the entire Digital World who could be called "Strong." Some were human, some were Digimon. Those who earned his recognition naturally became people I couldn't easily provoke. According to the order he gave... there were actually only three: DoruGoramon, HerculesKabuterimon, and LordKnightmon. I could have guessed the first and third—they were Dragon, the Chinese **Raiders****Order of Holy Knights**. Both were indeed very strong, without question. But that the second would be a bar owner was truly unexpected.

According to Master, the owner, Adam, was the one person who shouldn't be underestimated. His strength was extraordinarily great; he could effortlessly catch the "Iron Fist Punishment" thrown by Master. In contrast, even for me, I had never caught that move even once, getting sent flying by the same technique every time. This made me feel a loss of face and even a bit discouraged.

"Don't lose heart!" he rarely encouraged me. "He is an outlier. A standard species of HerculesKabuterimon would be completely incapable of doing what he does—at least not catching my iron fist so casually..."

Every time I met Adam, it was at the bar, so I never had the chance to see his Digimon form with my own eyes. To go deeper, I knew nothing about him. According to Master's account, Adam's HerculesKabuterimon was twice the size of the natural species found in the Digital World, and his strength left them far behind. He had once been fortunate enough to witness Adam's supernatural strength: at that time, to rescue the stranded Imperialdramon, Adam took on three berserk, giant GranKuwagamon single-handedly. Even with all three attacking together, they were no match for the strength of one person on his side, and the tide was quickly turned.

"The result?"

"One was stomped to death, one had its body crushed, and the other was blasted by his 'Giga Blaster: Deadly Ray' until not a trace remained. I was watching from the side, and the impact was extraordinarily strong—the scene was quite a shock."

"If it were you in the same battle..."

"It wouldn't have been easy either." He didn't spare himself at all. "Those three lethal things were also outliers, their internal data seemed to have been modified. Defeating them would have definitely taken me ten or twenty seconds longer than him."

Ending a battle with the duration measured in seconds—this is the world of the strong.

### Part 2: Betrayal in the Pentagon

#### Zero's Account (Part 2)

After lunch, I hurried into the Pentagon to see my superior in his office. I didn't want him to wait, nor did I want the Minister, whom I was meeting for the first time, to wait and have a bad impression.

"Good afternoon, Mr. Zero," the guard boy greeted me proactively. "Long time no see. It's rare to see you here."

"Isn't it," I followed up. "I almost thought I'd been fired."

The truth was, we met once or twice every day and were already like brothers.

I walked quickly through the corridors, turning into one office after another and passing many unfamiliar faces until I finally arrived at my superior's office door. Inside, three voices were laughing and talking, the atmosphere seemingly harmonious. After straightening my clothes, I raised my hand just as I was about to knock, and the door suddenly opened from the inside. What caught my eye was a girl—or rather, a woman whose clothes were just on the youthful side. Looking at her face, she was probably not many years off from me.

"Oh, look who's here."

The Secretary of Defense sat up from the sofa, warmly welcoming my arrival. At the same time, my superior introduced the lady who had just proactively opened the door for me: "This is Miss Judith, your new partner."

"Partner?"

I was very surprised. Zachary knew perfectly well that I always worked alone, so why would he arrange a partner for me? What puzzled me even more was that he hadn't discussed it with me beforehand, which was very unlike his usual style.

While I was thinking, Judith had already extended her hand to greet me: "Hello, Mr. Zero. I am Judith—you can call me Judy. Or, you can just call me LordKnightmon."

I was privately seething and didn't take her hand, nor did I give her a friendly expression, behaving very unamiably. Turning my head, I muttered: "Whatever."

This cold reaction was seen by Judy. She didn't take it personally but said "I'm glad to meet you too" to defuse the awkward scene. Then, with great etiquette, she invited me into the room and thoughtfully poured me a cup of coffee, which tasted as bitter as my current mood. Compared to her open-mindedness and cheerfulness, I was like a petty jerk. An internal self-contempt continued to operate in my heart, and holding it in was quite miserable; I couldn't wait for this meeting to end.

The reality was as I wished—the meeting lasted less than six minutes in total. During that time, the Secretary of Defense didn't waste a single word with us; every sentence was tied to the mission. He and Zachary coordinated to explain the situation to us, and the summary was very simple: my master was dead, and we needed to recover his data.

After learning this, I didn't feel much grief. At most, it was the kind of feeling one has upon graduating and parting ways—not quite sadness, but a certain emptiness in the heart.

The federal government didn't know I had such a master, or rather, in their eyes, I had nothing to do with this species called Gankoomon. I didn't want to bring feelings from my private life into my work, lest they cloud my judgment. So I had always adhered to the good personal rule of "If they don't ask, I don't tell," keeping this matter buried deep in my heart.

"Where did he die?"

"An old server," the Secretary of Defense said first. The detailed address was left to Zachary: "You log in from the Atrium, follow the Network Sea, head straight ahead, pass through a Data Forest and a Data Desert, reach the edge of the desert, find a Scumon, and tell it you are going to the 'Ruins'. It will guide you there. After entering, head directly to the lower space, 'Coulomb.' Find a way to locate his residual data and bring it back."

This mission sounded easy.

Before leaving the office, Zachary called me and warned: "Don't be careless, Zero. Don't die."

"Don't worry, I won't," I replied as usual. Then, I shifted my gaze to Judy beside me, pointed at her, and facing Zachary, asked: "What about her?"

My behavior provoked Miss Judy's dissatisfaction: "Thank you for your concern, Mr. Zero. Take care of yourself before worrying about others. Honestly, what era is this, to still look down on women..."

She grumbled, pushed my shoulder aside, passed me, and left first. In response, Zachary just shrugged helplessly and said no more.

"Good luck to us."

Closing the office door, I followed Judy's footsteps.

I knew she wanted revenge, so she deliberately kept her distance from me. Later, she even took it upon herself to treat me as her stalker—from an obstacle course walk inside the Pentagon to a light jog, it finally evolved into a street sprint. I didn't catch up with her in one breath but let her run until she was exhausted, leaning against a roadside railing and gasping for air, sparks flying before her eyes, as if suffocating. Only then did I walk up slowly to watch her embarrassment.

"You caught me... are you... satisfied now?"

I didn't respond but stepped forward, pinched her face, leaned in, and told her a settled truth: "No era looks down on women; what's looked down upon is always one's own seeking of death and self-righteousness."

"Aren't you... the same?"

"Stop with the backtalk."

I increased the pressure in my hand and then threw her aside, warning her that in reality, I could let her play out her little temper, but if it came to the Digital World, she had better consider whether she might become a pile of data fragments in the next second, sleeping forever in the world of data without even having a complete soul left behind.

She knelt on the ground, adjusted her chin, and then scrambled up pathetically. "Treating a lady so roughly—you are truly a gentleman, sir."

"Thank you for the praise. Don't mention it."

Our duo was destined not to be peaceful.

The login point was established in a bar in Clarendon named "A Bar." Find the bartender, show our IDs, and he will lead you to the innermost storage room. Inside are two partitioned cabinets, each installed with EDEN haptic equipment. The login environment was absolutely safe.

"Can I trust you?" I asked the bartender.

"Rest assured, sir," his response was sincere. "A secret base designated by the Department of Defense will have no problems."

*I hope so.*

Logging into the Atrium, passing through the firewall, and switching to Digimon form—everything proceeded quite smoothly before meeting the Scumon. Smoothly to an excessive degree, actually; we didn't see a single Digimon on the way. To be honest, this was no longer a matter of being smooth, but of being abnormal.

I asked Judy if she understood the situation. She sighed. "Evidently the same as you."

The two of us cautiously explored the desert. During this time, I thought of many things—mostly unrealistic speculations and hypotheses, with no small amount of self-doubt mixed in.

Meeting the Scumon, it was very unamiable toward our arrival, its mouth full of complaints like "You're late," "This isn't what we agreed on," and "Why did only two come?" None of it made sense to me. Looking at Judy, however, she handled it with ease, answering each of the Scumon's complaints.

"I'm warning you, take us there quickly, or we'll go back and report your lack of cooperation to the Department of Defense. You know their methods—you'll be going to see your friends."

Under her threat, we successfully reached a cave, connected to that old server, logged into the EDEN system, and entered the previously mentioned lower space, Coulomb. This place was a data tomb, and even more, a labyrinth occupied by data blocks of all sizes. No natural gravity or weight could be felt, as if in space—the whole person felt light as a feather, able to move in any direction without fear of falling from a height.

"Let's begin. It's a large place; I suggest we split up."

"Since when did you start making the calls?" I said to Judy like a bad boss.

"I thought I was a person—am I not?"

Her words left me speechless, making me quite embarrassed. Although I was reluctant, the mission came first, so I could only concede: "Fine, we split up. Search carefully, don't miss anything, and keep in touch at all times."

"Thank you for your concern," she started her snide remarks again. "Call me if something happens; I'll come save you. Don't lose your life for the sake of pride—it's not worth it."

She was truly self-righteous.

Wandering alone in the data labyrinth, no living thing could escape my keen eyes. When I say living things, I don't mean living things in the true sense, but a group of Ebemon. It was just one or two at first. I used my five Digimental Inscription Swords to execute them quickly. Later, the deeper I went, the more I discovered. When hundreds of Ebemon swarmed toward me, I realized I had fallen into their ambush.

The hunter had become the hunted, and the scene suddenly became lively. Weaving through beams of light and rays, I turned on my communication device to call Judy, but under the influence of those fellows, I couldn't establish contact with her. If she were in the same situation as me, she might already be in dire straits.

"Poor thing."

After feeling sorry for her for two seconds, I began to handle these mechanical modified products in earnest.

Zachary had once mentioned in front of me the Digimon experiments conducted in Area 51, saying the US federal government had captured a group of Vademon from the Digital World for research. Later, the entire facility's system was infected by an unknown virus. They couldn't stop the virus from spreading and didn't want it invading the mainstream network, so they had to cut their losses and seal them away. Who would have thought those viruses would invade the then-popular EDEN electronic space in a way humans couldn't imagine, causing the entire Coulomb region to fall. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say humans brought it on themselves.

These Ebemon were quite dangerous—at least, so the data said. Their left hands would release "Brain Rupture", launching a cracking program from the left muzzle toward the opponent's brain to suck out brain data and perform internal analysis, formulating collective combat strategies or even predicting the opponent's next move. Their right hands, "Planet Destroyer", would release massive energy—supposedly enough to destroy a planet instantly, though I doubted if that was true.

I estimated that Master Gankoomon had been besieged by them, outnumbered and unfamiliar with their combat style, leading to his failure and demise. Now it was my turn; I couldn't make the same mistake he did. I had to annihilate them in one go before they gathered more companions.

"Master, watch carefully!"

With the power of the three "Sword Spirits," I collectively formed a large green triangular prism in front of me. Then, I injected my own power into it, and the four of us combined to release a powerful green shockwave from within?All For One".

Those Ebemon weren't to be trifled with either. Although they hadn't analyzed my internal data, they had gained experience from previous battles and knew I could easily slash them, so none dared get too close. This resulted in the shockwave's energy accumulation being interrupted by the enemy's joint efforts. To prevent this, I specially pulled up the red cape behind me; it could help me resist for a while, allowing me to unleash "All For One" and clear out this rabble.

But I didn't expect an outsider to intervene and interrupt my charging. That outsider was none other than LordKnightmon Judy, who had come here with me. She actually stood on the side of the Ebemon, silently appearing behind me and joining them and the seemingly endless army of Knightmon under her command to launch a dead-end siege against me. The combination of long-range and close-range combat was very comprehensive. I could handle ten or twenty, but if hundreds or thousands came, I would truly find it hard to cope. Experiencing dual pressure from both physical and psychological levels simultaneously, I was momentarily unable to attend to everything. At this rate, I would sooner or later be forced into a corner.

"I'm sorry, Master!"

If you can't win, retreat—this was the last move he taught me. Although the process would be a bit pathetic, it could to a large extent avoid a portion of the danger, thereby preserving a life.

Preserve your life, and you can make a comeback. Master hadn't remembered this most basic of principles before his death. Perhaps it was his unyielding and obstinate character that led to his defeat, or perhaps his repertoire simply didn't include this so-called last move of "Retreating is the best path," only "Giving one's life in a desperate struggle."

In a daze, I seemed to hear again that sentence he often said to me: *Kid, don't die! Remember, if you die, no one will cry for you, no one will feel sad, and even less will anyone seek revenge for you.*

Yet, he was actually right.

### Part 3: Evolution of Jesmon GX

#### Zero's Account (Part 3)

The server entrance was set on the edge of the desert, where no one visited and no one would disturb—no matter how much noise was made, no one would notice. It was a perfect place for handling someone in the way. Unfortunately, that someone was me. After thirteen years of faithful service, risking my life for the nation and solving countless network security incidents, I was ultimately betrayed by my own superiors.

They wanted me dead because I was too elite.

If I didn't die, the spies ranked behind me wouldn't move up. If they didn't move up, the manpower would always be sufficient, and future new spy training plans would repeatedly fall through. The nation wouldn't allocate new funds, and they would have no way to exploit loopholes for embezzlement. Since it involved their interests and I was a social "invisible person" with no family and no friends, I naturally became that lamb to be slaughtered. It wasn't convenient to act in reality for fear of leaving evidence, so they used the mission as a pretext to lure me into the Digital Space and bring me to this place for a secret execution.

My master's death was merely a catalyst, or rather, an accident.

Using a data loophole in the network, he had previously discovered a problem with the Department of Defense's financial report for the last quarter. He conducted a private investigation and saw through their despicable trick of using me as a cover, intending to meet them to demand an explanation for his dear disciple—me. He didn't expect to be stood up by those scumbags and instead be met with the guns and cannons of a group of Ebemon.

The reason I knew this was because the culprit stood before me and confessed proactively. I hadn't expected them to come in person, probably fearing that their lapdog Judy wouldn't lead me to the right place.

"Look who's here."

That familiar voice came from the body of Craniummon. If he was the Secretary of Defense, then the Duftmon beside him must be Zachary.

These two rarely visited the Digital World, so I assumed they wouldn't be too troublesome. In a one-on-one duel, I had full confidence I could beat them. But the current situation was different—I had just escaped from a group of Ebemon's guns and cannons, heavily wounded and hit by multiple "Planet Destroyers," fortunately saved by my cape taking the hits. It had now honorably sacrificed itself, turning to ash and leaving me. Simultaneously, I had taken multiple "Brain Ruptures," causing certain problems with my mental state; the visual feed could cut out at any time, and I was at risk of being pincered by them from front and back and killed.

Fortunately, there was a firewall between the Digital World and the external server, which prevented the external virus from invading the network's interior—in other words, it blocked the Ebemon army. LordKnightmon Judy and her Knightmon were completely unaffected, as they originated from this side. They caught up with me from behind. Seeing me blocked by the two leaders and failing to escape, the heart that had been in their throats finally eased.

The Secretary of Defense said with a dark face: "You're late, Judy."

"My apologies, sir," her apology was sincere. "He was too fast, I... I did my best."

"Don't let it happen again." Zachary changed back from "Leopard Mode" to human form, speaking before the Secretary of Defense could, pardoning his subordinate's lapse while also preempting his superior's complaint to avoid turning on their own and letting me slip away.

I had to admit, Zachary was always shrewd and considered problems comprehensively; he was a natural "Strategist." It wouldn't be easy to escape from under his nose, even if the current me wasn't the me of before—dealing with the three of them plus a group of Knightmon would be a hard battle.

While fleeing in Coulomb, I unexpectedly obtained my master's Digicore. It was like a spirit wandering in space, looking for its master—me. It proactively approached the wounded me, entered my body, and merged with me. Subsequently, my body underwent a very noticeable change: the red and white across my entire body were swapped, and the three-in-one "Sword Spirits" merged with Master's "Hinokamuy", forming a brand-new spiritual armament attached to my back.

#### Jesmon, Evolve! —?Jesmon GX

Master's voice echoed in my ears, and I suddenly felt filled with power. Using this momentum, I immediately retaliated against these people who dared think they could take my life.

I utilized my main weapon, the "Endless Gauntlet", switching it into forms like sword, fist, and shield to target the three of them. The Secretary of Defense, Craniummon, was old and experienced, immediately unleashing "God Breath", using the magic shield "Avalon" to make my attacks ineffective for a short period. Seizing this chance, Zachary and Judy attacked from front and back, unleashing "Aussterben" and "Urgent Fear" respectively. The intense beams of light and the close-range shockwaves left me with only a choice between two sides for protection; no matter which I blocked, the other would hit. In that case, I might as well abandon defense and put all my energy into the subsequent counter-attack.

"Lend me your strength, Master!"

Focusing my gaze on my direct superior, Zachary, I drove the brand-new tactical armament, concentrating energy at a single point to unleash the ultimate technique inherited from Master?Seiken Metsuha". A series of sub-light-speed strikes, swift and graceful, allowed Zachary in the form of Duftmon to feel the full weight of his subordinate's resentment, leaving him no room to escape and personally burying him in this data desert to be carried away by the wind and sand.

"Father?"

Judy suddenly cried out behind me, and only then did I realize I had just done something foolish.

Her full name was Judith Lopez. Currently, she stood woodenly in place, unmoving and wordless, fallen into deep collapse, unable to accept the truth for the moment.

Looking at her, my sword hesitated. If killing a beast was for self-preservation, then killing the beast's daughter would surely be worse than a beast.

After only three seconds, Secretary Craniummon seized the opportunity. He lunged behind me, spinning his magic spear at high speed and unleashing his prized technique, "End Waltz". I intended to pull away quickly to dodge the massive shockwave, but a turn found me facing Judy; though I couldn't read the expression on LordKnightmon's face, I could still sense her pain and resentment through her trembling breath.

"Give me your life, you executioner!"

She coordinated with Secretary Craniummon, releasing four ribbon blades from her armor and unleashing "Spiral Masquerade" for my reception.

The situation was the same as before; I didn't dodge, instead taking these two sustained damage sources head-on, showing my most resilient side to explain to Judy: "I didn't want to do this. Your father... Zachary forced me."

She couldn't hear my words, still using the "Pile Bunker" on her right wrist to hammer my hard body over and over. For the current me, it was like scratching an itch, unable to cause any damage. Even if she sent more Knightmon to help, they would be cleared with a single slash. She knew this, yet maintained her persistence, swearing to avenge her father—it was clear how deep the feelings were between father and daughter.

To get rid of her, I had to be rough with her one more time. I swung my sword, sending her back into the embrace of the Knightmon army, then quickly turned, catching the Secretary's magic spear with my left hand and pointing the blade in my right hand toward him.

"I am not an executioner!" I stared fiercely at the culprit before me and told Judy: "He is!"

At this point in the performance, a clown would usually take off the mask and admit the truth—the same for the Secretary of Defense. He flipped the magic spear, turning the other end to thrust at me. I held my sword horizontally in my right hand, blocking his attack and entering a stalemate with him.

"I don't deny it," the Secretary of Defense said in person. "But you must also admit it."

I was furious, immediately roaring at him: "Admit what? That I am an executioner? Wasn't that thanks to you? Haven't I done enough dirty work for you before!"

Since he had already admitted it personally, I didn't need to waste any more words with him. Adhering to the philosophy that "betrayers must die," I flicked aside his magic spear with my sword, turned back, and delivered another slash, letting him personally experience the feeling of the body being split in two.

"You shouldn't have treated me like this."

Unfortunately, he left too quickly to hear these last words of mine.

After dealing with the two people who betrayed me, the only things standing in my way were a group of Knightmon and Judy, who led them.

"It's not over yet, Zero!"

Judy threw harsh words at me. I didn't respond because, from my point of view, this game was already over.

Without a doubt, the winner was me.

The outcome was decided, the player had left the stage, and a pawn shouldn't become a sacrifice in a game—whether for her or for me. Moreover, they were no match for me; even with a massive numerical advantage, they couldn't bridge the inherent gap in power. Continuing to fight had no meaning; her persistence was to avenge her father, while I had lost all reason for battle. So, I chose to let her go, sparing her life and showing a rare moment of gentleness. This was the first and last time.

"I don't hate you, Judith Lopez."

Leaving those words, I entered that desert again without looking back.

Draggin my scarred body and following the traces left by Scumon when it slipped away, I headed forward through the wind and sand. During this time, I thought about many things. This ordeal was exhausting and wounding, both physically and mentally. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say I had lost everything.

The hollow in my chest throbbed with continuous pain, from which my internal data kept gushing out. A portion had been infected by the virus carried by the Ebemon. Fortunately, when this body and underwent modification, it was equipped with a data reconstruction program; as long as there were supplementary data, it could function, transforming them into internal data compatible with my body, filling my wounds and discharging the infected virus, allowing me to regain vitality. My master's Digicore was the best supplementary data. If it hadn't been for it to sustain my life, I wouldn't have lasted this long.

Looking at the current situation, returning to reality was impossible. Judy clearly hadn't forgiven me; she would blame me for the Secretary's and her father's deaths, and the federal government would give her an answer. By then, I would not only have to bear the crime of being a murderer but also be called a traitor by the uninformed, suffering humiliation from all sectors of society. I'd never have a good day in this life.

Continuing to wander in the Digital World, I still had nowhere to go. The "Zero Domain" was forcibly blocked, and there were eyes planted by the federal government within the major guilds. I believed they would soon issue a warrant for me. When that happened, not only them but also a considerable number of greedy people would stand on the opposite side of justice, executing that so-called justice for another nation and another government.

Danger was everywhere, and everywhere would become my final resting place, leaving me no choice.

Thinking of this, my damaged body finally reached its limit. It pathetically collapsed in this desert, failing to make any expected response no matter how I tried to control it.

Gradually, my thoughts were blown away by the wind and sand, my will was submerged, and I lost my proper consciousness, experiencing the feeling of the soul ascending to heaven. In that moment, dreaming back to the beginning, it was as if Gankoomon was by my side, swearing and cursing with a heart full of passion, teaching me roughly as he always did. It felt very intimate and very nostalgic.

For a moment, I even felt that I had truly become Jesmon, truly had such a strict master, truly laid down the burden on my shoulders, said goodbye to the US federal government, and transformed from a tool into a living person.

### Part 4: Rescuing the Sisters

#### Zero's Account (Part 4)

When I woke up, I found myself in a tea garden, my body back in human form, lying on a rattan chair.

The owner of the tea garden sat beside me. He was an old acquaintance, the one I used to constantly target. With him there, my safety was guaranteed; I needn't worry about the federal government putting a bounty on my head in the Atrium, because no fool was willing to become his enemy—except for the former me, who didn't know the height of the heavens.

Seeing me wake up, he put on a sour face, casually picked up the teapot on the table, and poured me a cup of bitter tea that could scald me to death. With arms folded across his chest, mouth twisted, and eyebrows furrowed, looking as if I owed him thirty thousand US dollars, he wore a face that was quite unwelcoming as he greeted me: "You're actually still damn well alive."

"Sorry to disappoint you."

His appearance surprised me greatly, but also made me feel a touch of joy and tension.

"How long was I unconscious?" I asked.

"How should I know," he stated.

That was the harmonious way we got along.

"Explain why you were sleeping in the desert."

"Explain why you rescued me."

Our way of getting along was also very friendly.

"I don't pick up trash. It was Mante."

Subsequently, he explained the situation to me one by one. To summarize simply: he and Mante had gone together to execute a **Raid** mission, defeated the domain ruler Daemon, liberated a new Digital region, and returned in triumph. While passing through the desert, they found I was blocking their way.

"Stop being so sentimental," he interrupted. "We have eyes—we'd actively avoid trash."

The last battle with Leviamon had severely damaged Mante's GrandLocomon; after repairs proved fruitless, he had to announce its retirement and would no longer provide carrying services.

"I heard from the Russian guy at 'Mousse Mine' that the higher-ups are building a brand-new version of the database for him. It's a massive project and will take a long time. So, he has temporarily changed his form to HiAndromon. Where he got it, I'm not clear—you can go ask the leader of the **Steel Legions** guild if he's willing to tell you."

"Where is he?"

"Who, Mante? He was in a hurry to get back and submit the performance test report, no time to care about you."

So, he handed me, this broken piece of trash, to Dragon, which was why I appeared here.

Afterward, Dragon told me: "I've swapped positions with him."

"Why?" I was very puzzled.

"Asking the obvious—what kind of defense could a HiAndromon provide? Until his next version is developed, I'll be **Defense****Substitute**. Your rear will be guarded by me."

That last sentence made me break into a cold sweat; I could only say it was the result of a conditioned reflex.

"There is no US representative anymore."

"What?"

"The era of the five is over, Dragon." I couldn't help but sigh and confessed to him: "From now on, the UNSC **Raiders** only has four. Good luck, continue to explore, continue to be loyal to your countries, and perform your duties as tools. You are burdened with unlimited expectations—don't disappoint the people above, don't disappoint the people of your nations, and don't... disappoint me."

He snapped his fingers in front of me, interrupting. "Do you know what you're saying?"

"Of course," I stated. "I haven't reached the age of confusion yet."

I told him about my ordeal truthfully. Unlike my previous attitude, this time I was full of sincerity; after all, he was no longer my enemy, and there was no need to be constantly against him as before.

I focused on the matter of his pet sneaking back to her original residence, advising him to find her as soon as possible and arrange a new home to prevent the federal government from causing her trouble. In exchange, I hoped he could provide me with a relatively safe environment to continue surviving. If possible, I hoped to negotiate with the Chinese government through him to seek political asylum so I could return to reality and completely become a person again.

"Forget it. The Chinese government doesn't accept a dog that has bitten its master, even if that dog has no teeth." He rejected me righteously, then shifted the topic: "Do you like soaking in hot springs? I'll let you soak to your heart's content."

I didn't expect him to be even harder to break than me—hearing him say "thank you" was like reaching the heavens. However, he did express his gratitude with actions: he very generously gave me the volcanic lake previously used to house his pet, allowing me to hide there to convalesce and restore my body to its original state as quickly as possible.

"The Five... the Five are indispensable."

According to him, as long as I was still an American, the **Raiders** would still recognize my identity. With the backing of multiple other nations, there was no fear of threats from the US government.

"What if the **Raiders** face retaliation?"

"I will step in."

As he spoke, a trace of confidence naturally crossed his face, deeply shocking my heart. "It's been a long time since I've found a worthy opponent. Let them come—the more, the better. My skills aren't meant for hoarding."

Behind his peerless arrogance lay immense energy. Formidable and terrifying power, much like the DoruGoramon symbolizing terror and trepidation—having endured thousands of battles and always remaining undefeated. Every battle was an absolute affirmation of his own strength. Such a person, such a Digimon, had no reason to retreat, no reason to fear retaliation from others, and no reason not to protect the weak—for he *was* the strong.

We were once rivals and enemies. Now it seemed I was the one clinging to a higher branch. This time, he didn't just help me; he saved my life, preserved my face, kept my dignity, and didn't make me crawl on the ground begging like a truly fallen master. This was his greatest mercy to me.

I didn't know how to thank him, so I could only make a promise: in the future, I would never again monitor him or his pet. I would be duty-bound to help in any way needed.

"I don't need that last one... but the first one, you can keep appropriately."

His meaning was to have me take care of his pet for him. It just so happened that it wasn't convenient for me to show my face outside for the time being, and I couldn't participate in the **Raiders** side either—to be frank, I hadn't yet emerged from the shadow of being betrayed by my nation. And the so-called "taking care of" was nothing more than feeding fish and keeping watch to prevent others from plotting against his pet. Think about it carefully, and it wasn't a bad job.

"You don't plan to change her residence?"

"It's a 'she'—she is a person." He spoke in a solemn voice. "A young girl has her own pursuits; we grown men shouldn't be overbearing. If she wants to stay in the old place, let her. Going deep is too dangerous, and I'm not at ease either."

I advised him: "What's there to fear? She swallowed a Lilithmon before."

Without thinking, and without even hearing clearly, he stated: "Eating that kind of dirty stuff is unhealthy... What did you say? She ate what?!"

I truthfully repeated it: "The 'Demon Lord of Lust,' Lilithmon. Don't worry—she's a Vaccine-type, so she's not afraid of being infected. But it's best to be careful; if she develops a lustful heart for you, I can't help."

"Nonsense. And it's not like you *could* anyway."

With that, he stroked his chin and looked me up and down. Then he leaned in and asked: "What about you? If she has eyes for you and develops a lustful heart..."

"I'll be at your disposal."

"That won't be necessary."

I hadn't expected him to respond like that.

"What did you just say? Say it again."

He raised an eyebrow and stated: "Let nature take its course. Accept a relationship ten years younger."

*Relationship?* I didn't think one day I would harvest such a thing, which was completely unrelated to me. The role of the old father was played very well, but unfortunately, I didn't want to be his son-in-law.

"Fine. I'll just pretend I didn't hear that."

"As you wish," he didn't continue to make things difficult for me. "Just pretend I didn't say anything either."

At the moment, one problem remained before me: after Gankoomon's death, where did the Sistermon sisters go?

In the previous confrontation, I didn't remember the Secretary of Defense or Zachary mentioning them. Could that prove they hadn't met? Gankoomon, as usual, had placed them in a safe area, prioritizing their safety before going to meet his fate alone. If so, then they must still be alive.

"Dragon, have you seen a pair of Sistermon sisters?"

"If you mean the two new laborers at 'Mousse Mine,' then I have indeed seen them."

*Third time's the charm.* I didn't want to hear that name from him again.

Mousse Mine was originally an independent server used to reform network prisoners, which humans found very difficult to enter without external connections. The Digimon inside were just like me—all modified, and each one was fierce, terrifying, and a genuine monster.

My master Gankoomon had once had the fortune to go there, back then to save a friend of his. Those in charge of the guard work were a group of Deathmon to bring down "Hinokamuy" for heavenly retribution.

Afterward, Master, dragging his weary body, successfully rescued his friend. Unfortunately, on the way back, they were discovered by three giant GranKuwagamon on patrol and had their path blocked. Fortunately, it wasn't just them who were blocked; Adam, who had also come to rescue his fellow citizens and was also stopped by them, was there too. To protect the Imperialdramon behind him, Adam finally defeated them three-to-one. At the same time, Master realized that even among humans, there existed strong ones who could rival him.

I suddenly asked Dragon: "Who is the 'Russian guy at Mousse Mine' you mentioned?"

"Just a Russian guy, a proxy for the **Steel Legions** guild—not anyone major. Why? Do you have business with him? Don't tell me you want to go rescue those 'Sistermon sisters' you just mentioned."

"They are my family."

With a sense of shame, I successfully uttered these words I had previously kept buried in my heart. Immediately, they were met with his rebuttal: "Nonsense. When did those two Chinese girls become your family?"

I was very surprised and retorted: "They are human?"

"Nonsense! Are you the only one in the world allowed to be!"

"That's not what I meant..."

I explained the situation to him. After hearing it, he nodded slightly in recognition. "Treating them like family... I suppose that's understandable. However, I can responsibly tell you that they are indeed human, not Digimon."

"How can you tell?"

Dragon told me that the sisters had once suffered severe brain damage in a car accident and had become persistent vegetative states. Their father was a well-known Chinese Digimon scholar who didn't want his daughters to leave him, so according to their brainwave frequencies, he wrote a new set of Digital algorithms to allow his daughters to be reborn in the Digital World. One could tentatively understand them as people who had no 'User Identification Medal' but wouldn't be recognized as BUGs by the Atrium system.

I asked him again: "How do you know all this?"

"It so happens," he admitted proactively, "the director of that hospital is actually my distant cousin—the one you all know as the leader of the **Imperial Dragon's Nest** guild..."

*ShineGreymon: Burst Mode (BM).*

I hadn't expected such a relationship existed between them.

"Can you come help me?"

"What, afraid the Russian guy will play tricks on you and seek revenge? Don't be silly. He doesn't have the time..."

"Just say if you'll help or not."

One sentence, straight and to the point. Not just for me, but for him as well.

He picked up the teacup on the table, brought it to his mouth, took a small sip, and unhurriedly spoke that sentence full of helplessness yet extremely powerful?Only the weak are left in the mine." In other words, the strong inside had long since been taken care of by him.

He had helped me a huge favor again. I would remember his kindness, and him as a person.

"Hey, where are you going?"

"To save them."

He gave a wry smile. "What's the hurry? Finish this cup of tea before you go."

"The tea is too hot. I'll drink it when I get back."

### Chapter 9: Into the Water World

Acting as a network bodyguard, receiving the client, confirming the destination, and beginning the escort mission.

Like bodyguards in reality, we knew nothing about this client. Protected by privacy regulations, we had no right to inquire about their true identity, only to follow their request and ensure their safety.

Before hitting the road, Dove, acting as the executive representative for the **Free Birds**, confirmed the destination one last time: "The underwater guild, **Atlantis**... is that correct, Mr. Pufferfishmon?"

"There is a problem," he admitted proactively. "Actually, the destination should be the Deep Sea Temple."

"But the request clearly stated..."

"I wrote it wrong!" Pufferfishmon raised his voice, and seeing us all staring at him, he lowered it again. "Well, don't mind me, I wrote it like that on purpose. If I wrote 'Deep Sea Temple', I was afraid no one would take the job."

Falcon retorted, "Afraid it's too dangerous?"

"Sort of. Every time I went there, I was chased away. To put it bluntly, I wasn't strong enough. But maybe with your help, with your power, I can see her this time."

Things having developed to this point, Dove was scratching his head. He approached Owl and asked, "Captain, look at this... should we still..."

"Prioritize the client's wishes."

Owl gave a definitive answer. Then he confirmed with the client again: "The Deep Sea Temple is the private palace of Poseidon, the Guild Master of **Atlantis**. Outsiders aren't welcome. Are you sure you want to go there and die?"

"I'm sure."

"If something happens, you won't regret it?"

"No regrets," Pufferfishmon replied decisively. "She and I met there. That place holds our memories. I believe she must be waiting for me there... No matter the result, even if I just see her once, tell her how I feel, I'll be satisfied."

I didn't know these places or their locations, so I moved closer to Crane and asked for help. "Is there a difference between the two places?"

"A big difference," Crane told me. "**Atlantis** is in the Atrium, along the firewall edge; just head west to find it. But the Deep Sea Temple is hidden inside the Digital World, specifically in the depths of the 'Network Ocean', protected by multiple undercurrents and high water pressure. Ordinary aquatic types can't even reach it."

"Then we..."

"If we can't go under, we go over. We'll use the whirlpools to descend; it won't take much effort. The client has been there, he must know which whirlpool is closest. We'll follow him. Also, Dove won't join us. His mechanical body can't operate underwater, so he'll stay on the surface as backup."

To ensure the operation went smoothly, Dove prepared a new tracking device for himself to pinpoint our location from the surface, allowing him to follow us and provide artillery cover if necessary.

With everything confirmed, the escort officially began.

Crossing the firewall, passing through the forest, arriving at the coast—the journey was incredibly smooth. No one dared to find trouble unless they had the ability to deal with six Ultimates at once. But we actually ran into one. It was an AncientMermaimon. Just as we planned to dive into a nearby Great Whirlpool, she drilled out of it, holding a golden trident horizontally in front of her, blocking our path. It seemed she was here to stop us.

Falcon recognized her first, exercising his role as **Vanguard** to stir up the atmosphere. "Oh, look everyone! The Goddess Guardian of the Network Ocean has come to welcome us personally."

"Isn't she just."

Owl chimed in from the side. Then he directly called out her name: "Long time no see, Lana. I heard your 'UN Five' went to crusade against Leviamon? Why are you here now? Deserting? Or did you not go at all?"

"Don't look down on people with your dog eyes! Stop speculating!" Lana's tone was filled with anger. "This old lady is half-dead from exhaustion. I finally dealt with the 'Demon Lord of Envy', and on the way back, I saw you guys from roughly a mile away surrounding this prickly thing. What! Do you want to help a tyrant do evil?!"

Except for her and Pufferfishmon himself, none of us understood what she was saying.

Seeing our confusion, Lana realized we might not know the client's true face. She raised her trident, pointed it at him, and revealed his true colors to all of us **Free Birds**.

"This guy is a cyber hacker! He usually spreads rumors against the British Royal Family on the internet, posts attacks against them—slander, fabrication, distorting the truth, plus personal attacks! It has seriously affected their daily lives..."

Her revelation sounded more like a vent, mixed with full personal emotion, as if she herself was the persecuted one. I couldn't bear to listen to the rest, because it was all profanity.

I couldn't help but say to Crane, "This broad has quite a temper."

"You have a good eye," Crane sighed. "The foolish have their own foolish blessings. She married a member of the British Royal Family and might have a chance to become Queen in the future. Can her temper be small?"

"So, Guild Master Poseidon is her..."

"Exactly. They just got married not long ago. He built a Deep Sea Temple to fulfill his kingdom dream ahead of schedule."

"Crane, do you think Owl will terminate the agreement with the client to protect the reputation of our **Free Birds** and give up this mission?"

"Who knows." Crane crossed her arms. "Anyway, in my impression, he is not a fickle person. Based on my understanding of him, probably not."

Fact proved Crane right; Owl indeed did not waver because of this matter. He took the initiative to shield the client, standing alone in front of him, facing the trident in his old friend's hand, and stated his attitude: "One-sided words cannot be trusted; who knows if what you say is true. Things that happen in reality should be solved in reality. The network has its own rules. Please, Ms. Lana, show some mercy and don't make it difficult for us **Free Birds**."

"Keep dreaming! The Deep Sea Temple will never welcome a social tumor like him!"

Seeing Owl give her no face, Lana simply tore off the facade with him, showing no regard for old feelings, and stated bluntly: "I'll leave my words here today, Owl. Whether it's you or those behind you, whoever dares to assist him in taking one step into the 'Network Ocean', I'll make them suffer the consequences!"

"Lana, I'll ask you one last time," Owl said, inevitably disappointed. "Do you really want to be our enemy?"

"I should ask you!" The trident continued to approach Owl's face. "Do you really want to protect this guy who opposes us everywhere and makes our lives a mess? Hmph, fine. Friend or foe, it was determined the moment you took this commission!"

"Is that so?" Owl drifted a sentence lightly. "In that case, don't blame me."

"Come on! I'm not afraid of you!"

As Lana spoke, she raised the trident in her hand, rising a huge whirlpool that trapped all of us inside. We were momentarily flustered; before we could react, in the next second, Lana used the trident to drive the seawater on the wall of the whirlpool, throwing her best Special Move at us—"Crystal Billow."

Crystallized water, harder than metal. It struck like a torrential rain. If not for Dove's huge natural steel body, everyone would have been left with a few holes.

The battle began. Falcon took the lead, using "Wolf Claw Circle" to bounce off all the water crystals shot at him, quickly approaching Lana. Lana knew she couldn't win by strength, so she summoned a current in time to slap Falcon out of the whirlpool. Meanwhile, the "Dark Despair" loaded on Crane's left hand was about to arrive. Lana had no time to dodge, so she curled up, used her fish tail to borrow force, and fanned Crane's head, causing her body to tilt to one side. Finally, she used the trident to send her to the bottom of the whirlpool.

Seeing this, Owl quickly removed the Brave Shield from his back, held it in front of him, stepped on Dove's huge body, leaped with all his might, and charged head-on in Lana's direction, directly slamming her into a nearby water wall.

"Sakura, take him down quickly. I'll stall Lana."

"Understood!"

Owl dove into the water and fought with Lana. Taking this opportunity, I quickly grabbed our client, Pufferfishmon, jumped off Dove's shoulder with him, and fell towards the bottom in the direction Crane had fallen.

"Was what she said just now... true?"

I sought confirmation from the client, hoping he would refute it. Unexpectedly, he nodded in affirmation: "For a living, I had to do it, otherwise... I, I also have difficulties! Please believe me!"

This was the first time I had encountered such a pale and feeble explanation.

"Whether to believe depends on me; whether you did it depends on you."

This was an established reality, beyond doubt.

I advised him: "I believe no one in this world wants to do things against their conscience. So, next time, before doing such a thing, ask yourself, ask your conscience, whether you are building your happiness on the suffering of others. Will the person you have always looked forward to seeing forgive you?"

After hearing my words, he chose silence.

I am not a saint, nor an emotional expert. I can't say beautiful words. I can only do my best to let the parties involved conduct a minimum level of self-reflection. I hope he can awaken the kindness sleeping in his heart and stop causing trouble for others.

"By the way, you said before that you were chased away every time you went. Who does this 'they' refer to?"

"The 'Amphibious Brothers'. You should have heard their names. They... Watch out—"

He suddenly shouted at me, then grabbed my hand, pulled my body, and threw a "British Buttonhook" behind me. Listening to the sound, it seemed to hit a very hard metal product. Looking back, it wasn't a metal product at all, but clearly a MetalSeadramon. It had just wanted to rush in from outside the whirlpool and swallow me whole. Fortunately, my client discovered it in time and acted in time, saving my little life.

"Thanks."

"A piece of cake. Ouch, it hurts..."

Indeed, even with knuckles protected, punching metal wouldn't feel good.

"...It's the 'Amphibious Brothers'. They're here." He explained to me while rubbing his fist, "It will take some time to reach the bottom of the whirlpool. They will hover around, looking for opportunities to attack us. Triplets, three brothers, three MetalSeadramon that look exactly the same. Be careful, they are not easy to deal with."

His last sentence reminded me. It forced me to distract myself and pay attention to the surroundings, preventing the other two dangerous guys from suddenly drilling out from behind the water wall.

"How did they come?" I couldn't figure it out.

The client answered my doubts: "All 'Great Whirlpools' are created by AncientMermaimon. The 'Amphibious Brothers' are responsible for taking turns to guard these whirlpools. If one is frustrated, the other two can quickly sense it and come over."

"Watch out—"

We both shouted at the same time. The difference lay in the direction we were facing. He faced down, I faced up. One up and one down, two MetalSeadramon stuck their heads out from behind the water wall, forming a pincer attack, opening their bloody mouths and pouncing on us.

The disparity in size left us nowhere to hide. My "Rose Rapier" could not pierce the **Chrome Digizoid** covering the MetalSeadramon's body. The spikes covering Pufferfishmon's body were of the same material and might have been useful; knowing this, he wanted to use his unique move "Needle Squall" to resolve the crisis, but to take care of me beside him, he hesitated until the end and had to give up.

At the critical moment, Falcon and Crane arrived in time. One used "Crescent Haken," sending out countless yellow beast crescent blades formed of ice; the other used her right arm to release the arrow of light "Holy Hope." The two of them, one high and one low, pincered the pincer attack of the Sea Dragon brothers, successfully saving us.

"Are you okay, Sakura!"

Falcon sent a greeting to me on behalf of Crane. After I expressed that I was fine, they both showed me a state of recognition at the same time, making me feel very uncomfortable, as if I had been underestimated by them.

"You did a great job."

"You don't need to say it." I reminded Crane, "Get ready, they are coming again!"

The client was the protected object. Unless absolutely necessary, he shouldn't be allowed to act.

Falcon and Crane were born warriors. They each pinned down a MetalSeadramon, scattering left and right, leaving only me. My whole body wasn't covered by a single piece of metal, yet I had to deal with a steel dragon covered in metal alone. This was almost an impossible task.

Right now, there was no room for hesitation, nor any chance to retreat. The muzzle at the tip of his nose was aimed at me, "River of Power" poised to fire. I couldn't care about anything else; I had to bite the bullet.

"Don't underestimate me!"

Expressing the emotions suppressed in my heart, I concentrated all my energy and released "Forbidden Temptation" to counter the wave.

Limited by the space of the whirlpool wall, the red and green light waves didn't have enough space to continue the stalemate. The contest between them eventually evolved into a fixed-point blasting mode. The huge shock caused lifted the water wall and blocked the whirlpool current. The surging seawater hit me head-on. With my relatively petite figure, I couldn't resist it at all. I could only be ruthlessly swallowed, merged into the vortex, and sank to the bottom of the sea, ending up with no one to care for me.

*So I thought*, and my body went limp unconsciously. Dancing freely with the turbulent flow, all struggles seemed so powerless; not only was I dizzy, but my limbs were completely out of my control. My torso felt like it was about to be torn apart by the strong current, and my throat was filled with seawater, unable to call for help.

Suddenly, a pair of strong hands hugged me from behind. Turning my face to look, what caught my eye was my hero—Owl. He had saved my life once again. To save me, he had been forced to give up his entanglement with Lana.

I stared at him foolishly. For a moment, I even forgot that he was my captain.

"Get up quickly! How can the **Support** fall first!"

Expecting to seek romance from him, I was definitely out of my mind.

He took me out of the water wall and returned to the cavity created by the Great Whirlpool, reuniting with Falcon, Crane, and our client. At this moment, the three MetalSeadramon opposite had already set up their killing formation, simultaneously transporting energy to the muzzles at their nose tips, and then releasing it without explanation.

Three brilliant green "River of Power" beams converged together. The generated impact was unstoppable, capable of overturning everything in front of it. As the Captain, Owl had to remove the Brave Shield from his back, prop it in front of him, rush forward, and forcibly bear this powerful blow for us.

"Hey, that's too reckless!"

"Captain, you..."

"Don't, Owl—"

The voices of Falcon, Crane, and me rose and fell. Accompanied by our three shouts, Owl first resisted with the shield for two or three seconds, then was directly blown away by the strong impact, disappearing without a trace.

Including the client, everyone was stunned, unwilling to believe everything they had just seen. Deep in the ocean vortex, unable to attend to the Captain's safety—Dove would naturally go to save him on the surface—all we could do was focus on these aquatic enemies before us and vent the anger burning in our hearts on them.

Four against three. Not enough hands? The client will make up the number.

Representing the **Support** position, I issued an invitation to him: "Mr. Pufferfishmon, please lend us a hand."

He clenched his fist and declared righteously: "I will go all out!"

### Chapter 10: Raging Tides and Furious Roars

Owl's exit encouraged their morale, but at the same time, it also ignited our fighting spirit.

Enemy and friend alike engaged in a death match surrounded by the Great Whirlpool. Falcon went to deal with Lana, leaving Crane, me, and our client Pufferfishmon—three of us—to deal with the "Amphibious Brothers."

Blades against tridents, Beast Wolf against Mermaid. It wasn't sparks that were struck, but grains of crushed ice. "Crescent Haken" met "Crystal Billow" head-on; unknowingly, a layer of ice fog shrouded the already cramped center of the whirlpool. Looking out through the ice fog, I saw a Mastemon dodging the devouring giant mouth of a MetalSeadramon back and forth; she kept sending arrows of light released from her right arm behind her, which were constantly destroyed by the wave cannons shot by the other side. Not far from them, Pufferfishmon unleashed "Needle Squall" with all his might, followed by a "British Buttonhook" that hit the MetalSeadramon's muzzle head-on, instantly silencing it. Observing his move, I began to imitate him; facing the muzzle turning towards me, I took advantage of my agile figure, used "Thorn Whip" to wrap around his mouth, and just as he finished charging, I used "Rose Rapier" to thrust straight into the muzzle.

The MetalSeadramon let out a painful wail. After that, the energy storage device inside its muzzle was destroyed, causing the energy within to break through the constraints of the metal muzzle and scatter in all directions. Finally, under one of my "Forbidden Temptations," he completely broke away from the pain. The ruptured muzzle emitted puffs of black smoke, and his huge body tilted to one side, slowly falling towards the seabed along the whirlpool wall.

"Beautifully done, Sakura!"

Crane was the first to send me congratulations. Not to be humble, I, the **Support**, gave them a good start.

With one brother defeated, the other two wouldn't feel good either. They turned their heads one after another, gave up their previous opponents, locked their targets on me again, harboring anger, swearing to avenge their brother. Of course, if they wanted to touch me, they had to ask the others if they agreed first.

Crane flapped the five pairs of wings on her back and caught up at full speed, using "Dark Despair" on her left arm to deal with the frontal impact of the "River of Power." The energy of the wave cannon came from inside the MetalSeadramon's body. Like him, it was composed of data and would also be deleted as fragmented data by Crane's left hand. Crane realized this, and after confirming that she could continue to resist, she went up against the muzzle and used the same "muzzle blocking" method as me to end another one.

"One last one left." Crane said, taking the initiative to send me an invitation: "Let's go together, Sakura."

I never refuse such requests.

However, the situation did not go as smoothly as we thought. Because two brothers had been defeated in succession, the last one didn't want to fall into the same situation as them, so he was unusually desperate and unusually full of power. My "Thorn Whip" passed through the blade hole on his head, yet he could still throw us off his head, showing that his anger had reached an extreme point.

Finally, there was really no way. To save our lives and the client's life, and not be harmed by this crazy MetalSeadramon, Crane had no choice but to sacrifice her ultimate move—"Chaos Degrade."

"Sorry, I didn't want to do this..."

Crane rarely showed her gentle side. Seeing that the other party refused to stop, she hardened her heart and sent out the light and dark energy gathered on her left and right hands. The two merged with each other, gradually producing a dimensional gate that would suck everything around it into it for a complete burial.

"It's over." I stretched and sighed a long sigh. Just as I wanted to show a relaxed mood, in the next second, I was frightened by a voice coming from behind.

"It's still too early!"

Looking back in the direction of the source of the voice, there seemed to be something inside the water wall. Immediately afterwards, a spear suddenly sprang out from behind the water wall. The speed was so fast that it was difficult to catch with the naked eye. It directly pierced the energy center and prevented the manifestation of the dimensional gate. The violent explosion caused directly dispersed the water wall of the Great Whirlpool, calming all the turbulence and currents in front of us.

After that, the spear returned to its owner's hand. Following its direction, we saw the figure hiding behind the water wall. Like Lana's AncientMermaimon, he dragged a long fish tail behind him. Compared to Lana's slender version, his was much thicker; his body was covered with scale armor made of Blue Digizoid, making the whole look extraordinary and giving people a very majestic feeling. Judging by appearance alone: he was a strong man.

"I wondered who dared to be presumptuous at my door. It turned out to be a group of free birds. Oh? And missed a bedbug."

"You are the bedbug..."

Pufferfishmon spoke this sentence with difficulty. His rebuttal sounded so weak and feeble at that moment.

Being able to speak underwater proved that he was an aquatic king no less than the other four. Saving one of the "Amphibious Brothers" as soon as he made a move, his strength could not be underestimated. Seeing that we were affected by the explosion, shocked into losing our fighting spirit, and stunned by the strong ocean current, he didn't lower himself to our level anymore. Instead, he turned his spearhead to Falcon, who was dueling with Lana on the other side. In his words, insulting him was fine, but bullying his woman was absolutely not allowed.

I didn't expect him to be Poseidon, the Guild Master of **Atlantis**, or perhaps I should call him the King of the Deep Sea Temple, Neptunemon. Intuition told us that next, Falcon would die miserably.

Thinking of this, Crane grabbed my hand and pointed her other hand in Falcon's direction, seemingly signaling me to save him quickly. I understood immediately and swam towards Falcon, dragging my body which was healing at extreme speed; a Rosemon recovers as long as there is water. Whenever conditions allow, sometimes, it is just that convenient.

By the time I arrived, Falcon had already undergone a beating. He was choked by the neck one at the front and one at the back by the aquatic couple, unable to breathe, struggling constantly in the water. The "Crescent Moon Sword" in his hand had fallen elsewhere, stuck in the coral on the seabed far away from him. It took me a long time to pull it out.

I was just about to go up and help him when suddenly a loud noise came from above my head, and the surging current that followed almost washed me away again. Fortunately, I had the Crescent Moon Sword; sticking it into something made it safe. Looking up, a "Giga Missile" shot into the sea and detonated under the action of a "Dark Gaia Force." The impact caused forced the couple to let go of their prey for self-preservation.

After the explosion, Owl dove back into the seabed to protect his little brother Falcon and let him retreat to the surface to join Dove first, staying behind to deal with these two barbaric spouses himself.

"Who are you calling barbaric!"

Lana was ten thousand times unwilling after hearing his address for herself. She was just about to get angry, but was stopped by Poseidon with one hand: "Honey, don't get angry with barbaric invaders. just figure out a way to kill them."

As soon as these words came out, both sides immediately started fighting.

One against two, Owl was always at a disadvantage. I could never intervene in the battles between them, the strong, nor could I intervene, because I was actually still a long distance away from them—I could only see them. They could be lively and vigorous underwater, but I couldn't. After all, my strength was limited and I couldn't easily overcome the water pressure and current. But that didn't mean I would choose to sit and wait for death. Interfering with the enemy is also a way of **Support**.

Throwing out the "Thorn Whip" in my left hand to bind Lana and releasing high-voltage electric shocks to temporarily restrain her—in this way, Poseidon wouldn't focus all his attention on Owl, and Owl could take this opportunity to use "Black Tornado" to defeat the opponent in one fell swoop.

However, I seemed to forget to consider one point. Owl's opponent was a Guild Master. Dealing with him was far from that easy. What I never expected was that the stick spear in his hand named "Vortex Penetrate" actually possessed its own thoughts. After being thrown by its master, it could change its moving direction underwater on its own, find the thorn vines binding its master's wife, bite them off with the "Terrible Bite" at the head, and bring her freedom again.

"Honey, leave that girl over there to you."

"No problem. You also keep an eye out on your side; the captain of the **Free Birds** is very difficult to deal with."

"Haha, I'll verify the range of his knowledge. I didn't become this Guild Master for nothing!"

Being able to fight with the representative of the British **Raiders** was my honor. Unfortunately, I love peace and didn't want to have too many entanglements with her, especially in this situation where the client was nowhere to be seen. To put it rudely, I felt it was unnecessary.

She carried the trident in her hand and rushed towards me aggressively. I had no choice but to accept the challenge. I released a very long string of vines in advance and used it to stir the seawater, creating a whirlpool to attack her. As a result, she was not affected at all and still kept coming towards me at a very fast speed.

If you think my strength is only this much, then you are very wrong.

Since I knew she was an aquatic type, I naturally wouldn't use moves on her that wouldn't have much effect on aquatic types. Such stirring was actually just to lure her into my trap. Then, with a tight pull, she was bound by me again. She had to cooperate, otherwise the high-voltage current would make her feel good.

Reasonably speaking, if you are captured, you should be obedient and stop causing trouble. However, this woman named Lana broadened my horizons. She was worry-free to a certain level; relying on her mermaid advantage, she continuously dragged me, who was binding her, in the water. The purpose was estimated to distract my attention so that I wouldn't have time to care about the two men above. I kept a relatively safe distance from her at all times to prevent her from slapping me dizzy with her fish tail. Gradually, I couldn't stand her anymore. Underwater, I couldn't threaten her with words, so I had to show the Crescent Moon Sword in my hand to her. After that, she stopped a lot.

Really, wouldn't it have been over if you did this earlier!

To prevent her from attacking while I wasn't paying attention, I used "Rose's Cradle" to hypnotize her. This way, I could free my hands, coil her fish tail on her trident, and let her take a nap alone on the seabed, so I could spare time to go up and help Owl. He was now in a temporary crisis. I didn't know if it was because of attribute restraint or because he wasn't familiar with the ocean terrain, but he was firmly fixed to a reef by Poseidon with the spear in his hand; the fish-head spear tip continued to gnaw at his arms, and the connection between his arms and the "Dramon Killers" was also miserably gnawed. He was now unilaterally reduced to the bullied party, looking indescribably aggrieved.

How could I watch my hero suffer such grievances? A "Thorn Whip" lashed out, hitting his fish tail—to be precise, his buttocks—successfully attracting his attention.

Owl must have been extremely puzzled by my death-seeking behavior. Of course, this was my guess; don't expect to observe any expression on BlackWarGreymon's face—it's the same for other types of Digimon.

"Little girl, you shouldn't anger a king."

"You shouldn't shout at my hero in front of me either."

In the water, of course, this sentence couldn't be spoken. I could only prove it with my actual actions. "Forbidden Temptation" was the best example. Although it was blocked by Poseidon spinning the spear in his hand, it gave me enough opportunity to deliver the Crescent Moon Sword in my hand to my hero.

"Hack him!"

My eyes said this to Owl. I hope he could understand.

He unloaded the "Dramon Killers" mounted on his arms, took the Crescent Moon Sword I sent, and instantly regained his spirit. Seeing this, Poseidon's face was a little flustered, but he quickly recovered.

"Afraid of you just because you changed weapons? Take this—"

Just as he said, changing weapons indeed couldn't completely hold him off, but at least he could fight back and forth with him in the water, not falling into a situation of being beaten.

The two strong men continued to fight. Gradually, Guild Master Poseidon lost his patience. He was anxious to decide the winner and go find his other half. Taking the opportunity of the spear holding the Crescent Moon Sword, he used "Gate of Atlantis" on Owl, summoning a huge water column to attack Owl head-on. The power was no less than a single "River of Power." Even if Owl held the Crescent Moon Sword to resist, he was sent a long distance away, finally hitting a nearby reef, drifting slowly from the water like a shell.

Rushing to his wife's side, when he found his wife unconscious, Guild Master Poseidon could no longer suppress the emotions in his heart. Without waiting for me to explain with simple gestures, he used that "Vortex Penetrate" which was enough to penetrate the dimensional gate on me.

Its speed was swift, like lightning. One second it left his hand, the next second it was approaching my eyes. I didn't have time to dodge. Watching the spear tip about to hit, a yo-yo suddenly flashed past my eyes, pushing aside the pair of fatal spear tips for me. Immediately afterwards, a familiar voice came from behind me: "Guild Master Poseidon is very merciless to our people. Fear he doesn't want to actively provoke a struggle between guilds, huh."

The one who saved me was none other than the Guild Master of the **Sylvan Garden**, "Flower" (BanchoLilimon). Her appearance was very unexpected to me, but as long as she was there, Guild Master Poseidon wouldn't dare to touch me unless he wanted to fight one against two—to be precise, one against three, because Owl had regained his fighting spirit at this time.

"You really have the nerve to say that!" Poseidon shouted at us angrily. "The intruders are clearly you guys! Look at the surrounding environment. A perfectly good Network Ocean has been messed up by you. I see, you are just looking for trouble sincerely, deliberately coming to fight me!"

Guild Master Flower didn't think so. She showed a delicate appearance, took one of my arms, treated me as her good sister, hid behind my body, and said to her old acquaintance Poseidon: "In my opinion, they don't have the time. As for me, routine inspection, running around to see if any Guild Master is wantonly provoking disputes, forgetting Senior **Muba**'s parting instructions, and wanting to engage in that mutual opposition set. Oh my, I didn't say it was you, don't mind, ha."

Her words undoubtedly alerted the other party.

"You are still as despicable as before, Flower, actually daring to use Senior **Muba** to suppress me."

"It's you yourself who has a bad memory and needs me to remind you."

I didn't quite understand who the "**Muba**" they were talking about was. Whenever this name was mentioned, both of their tones would involuntarily become respectful.

"Fine, you win this time!" Poseidon swallowed a breath unwillingly and said, "For the sake of Senior **Muba**'s face, I'll let you off today. But, remember this! From now on, don't step into the Network Ocean again! Otherwise, even if you escape back to reality, I won't let you go!"

"Thank you, Guild Master Poseidon, for your understanding. We won't disturb your world of two anymore. Leaving first."

After that, Guild Master Flower hurriedly pulled me and Owl into the space tunnel she cut open to evacuate in time. I asked her why she was in such a hurry. She said she was worried Poseidon would change his mind.

"Don't believe any promise that guy makes; who knows when he'll forget it."

Looking at it this way, we were quite lucky. Thanks to Guild Master Flower coming to the rescue, otherwise I really wouldn't dare to think about what would happen later and what kind of dangerous situation we would encounter.

"By the way, Guild Master, why did you come?"

"Little Snake called me. She accidentally heard someone in the bar talking about the 'Amphibious Brothers,' saying they were patrolling the waters near the Deep Sea Temple. As soon as she thought of you guys, she rushed to find me for help, so I came."

As a result, she was a step late and happened to bump into the Guild Master of **Atlantis**.

"Then she..."

"Went back to drinking. She has a huge capacity for alcohol. She often brags to us that she alone can drink 'Drink a Glass Bar' out of business. Don't tell the boss about this, otherwise he will raise the price again."

How to say it... there were too many slots in just two sentences of dialogue; I didn't know which part to complain about.

Our matter came to an end for the time being. With the help of Guild Master Flower, the commission was successfully completed. Pufferfishmon finally saw the person of his heart. The other party was a MarineAngemon.

"Want to know why our client is so persistent?"

I became interested in the question Owl raised: "Tell me."

"Because both of them are like you. The 'Trial Badge' device was accidentally damaged, and they can only stay in this world composed of data. This place is their everything."

*This place is also my everything.*

Pufferfishmon fell in love with a person in the Deep Sea Temple. She was MarineAngemon.

They used to be too weak to roam and survive in the Digital World together, so they had to rely on the strong to survive. Pufferfishmon chose **Mutant Research Lab**, and MarineAngemon chose **Atlantis**. Before parting, the two made a promise: whoever gained power first must not forget the other, must go to the guild the other belonged to to find the other, always worry about the other, and never forget the other.

Such a story sounds romantic, but in fact it is an invisible shackle. Just like the lonely me. There are always days when Owl and the other companions of the "Free Birds" will log out of the Atrium and return to reality to enjoy their lives and their lives, while I can only stay here alone, accompanying a bar owner named Adam, helping him out, acting as a bar girl, and taking care of these adults who are like babies.

Boring but fulfilling. Maybe life is just like that.

### Chapter 11: Hephaestus's Forge

This story is a long one.

That day, the **Free Birds** received a commission. The content was simple: lead our client to "Hephaestus's Forge" to find the smelting blacksmith there, Teacher Changsun, to repair the damaged metal data on his body. Just leading the way for a newcomer was our honor as seniors. However, when we arrived, we found that Teacher Changsun was not in the house. We asked around the neighbors for a long time, but no one knew where he went. This put us in a difficult position.

In Owl's words, having known Teacher Changsun for so long, he had never seen him leave his territory, let alone without saying hello or leaving a note. It was contrary to his rigorous style of doing things.

"Could it be that he has an urgent matter?"

My unauthorized speculation was unanimously denied by everyone.

According to their description, Teacher Changsun is a 95-year-old ethnic Chinese with inconvenient legs and feet. It is rare and difficult for him to travel far alone unless he switches to the image of a Digimon; in that case, he will change his past aging state and return to the youngest state in his life. With the body of Vulcanusmon, he walks as fast as flying. The eight arms on his body are quite recognizable. Once seen, he will leave a very deep impression on people.

After that, we asked people nearby again, but no one had seen him. Having no choice, we had to persuade the client to return to his guild to wait until Teacher Changsun came back, or until we found him and then led him over.

Three days later, we searched all the streets of the Atrium, big and small, but still found nothing.

Returning to the **Drink a Glass Bar** in disgrace to accept the verbal teasing of the regular customers, just as we were about to enjoy the wine treated by a few of them, a flustered man suddenly broke in from outside the door, lying on the table nearest the door, panting heavily. I looked at him and found him somewhat familiar. I leaned over and saw that it was our client. He conveyed a very bad piece of news to us, bad enough to make the originally noisy bar silent.

"It's bad, it's bad... well, our guild got into a fight with the **Windrunner Brigade**..."

*So what?* I seemed to have written this sentence on my face.

Seeing this situation, Owl took the initiative to come over, pulled me aside, and intimately added a part of the setting for me: "The current Atrium is different from the past. Guild struggles are explicitly prohibited. Once anyone violates the 'peace' principle set at the beginning, whether it is provoked by personal reasons or by the guild, both sides of the struggle will suffer severe punishment from the Mediation Organization."

The Mediation Organization he referred to was the Olympos XII. At that time, the Atrium was still in the public beta period, the **Raiders** had not yet been established, and the "Promotion Seed" had not yet been designed. The ten major guilds were hostile to each other, and there were pitifully few Ultimates. The development team specially selected twelve Ultimates with the most "responsibility" attribute from 99,999 test accounts, granted them the ability of Deity Evolution, allowing Digimon at the Ultimate level to evolve into temporary Megas, forming a mediation organization composed of twelve Megas, counting on them to quell the struggles between guilds.

"Only when the twelve of them are present at the same time can they obtain the ability of Deity Evolution. Once anyone dies in battle, logs out, or is beaten to degenerate, the remaining eleven will immediately revert to their previous Ultimate state."

To sum up in one sentence: counting on them at that time was completely unreliable.

In the process of mediation, it was often encountered that the two sides of the dispute united to beat one person in the mediation organization; as long as that person was beaten to degenerate, the remaining eleven would also degenerate. After cleaning up the mediation organization, most of the two sides of the dispute would shake hands and make peace, leave, and at most fight a little more without hurting their lives, stopping at the point.

"Sparrow was also one of them. Evolving from Angewomon to Venusmon, she carried out the love and peace she believed in to the end. So innocent, so pure and beautiful... We met under such circumstances."

The behavior of the Mediation Organization was thankless, not to mention that it was extremely possible to lose a life.

The development team also realized this. After the Atrium system was officially operated, they strengthened the ability of Deity Evolution, changing "temporary evolution into Mega" to "permanent evolution into Mega," and dissolved the connection between the twelve people, allowing them to maintain independent individuals and come forward to preside over mediation work when contradictions arose between guilds.

After that, Poseidon voluntarily withdrew from the Mediation Organization, took over the **Atlantis** guild, and became the Guild Master there. The Mediation Organization thus became eleven people. At that time, Sparrow took into account both the Mediation Organization and the **Free Birds**. When following the **Free Birds** to carry out a **Raid** mission, she encountered an unexpected event and was beaten back to Ultimate by Diablomon, losing the ability of Deity Evolution forever; before the development team could design a new Deity Evolution program for her, she was taken away from the world by illness one step ahead.

"Currently, there are only ten people left in the Mediation Organization."

Ten people, none of whom were fuel-efficient lamps. Every one of them possessed the strength of a Guild Master level. No guild had the ability to rival them. Their existence was a disaster.

"Owl, what did you mean by severe punishment just now?"

He answered me directly in a different tone: "It means slaughter."

"Huh?"

I was deeply shocked by his answer.

According to him, under normal circumstances, as long as the two sides of the struggle didn't fight and cooperated with the work of the Mediation Organization, under their mediation, if the attitude of both sides improved, they wouldn't lower sanctions. But this time, the dispute happened to be between **Fang of the Beast King** and **Windrunner Brigade**. One was the brave guild with the strongest self-esteem in the whole Atrium and the least tolerance for others pointing fingers at them; the other was the free guild in the whole Atrium that yearned for freedom the most and was not bound by various rules and regulations. Beast against Bird, Tooth against Claw. The two didn't get along to begin with. With the addition of a Mediation Organization, if they really made a scene, they might overturn the entire Atrium.

"Neither of the two Guild Masters is easy to talk to. If neither of them cooperates, then they can only be enemies with the Mediation Organization. To put it bluntly, it means dragging the people of the entire guild to die together. With the strength of their two guilds, all people added together cannot be the opponents of those ten guys, unless..."

"Unless?"

His words attracted my attention, as well as the attention of everyone in the entire bar.

"...Count us in."

As soon as the voice fell, the whole audience was inevitably in an uproar. Everyone was doubting their ears. Many people were stunned in place, at a loss, including our client and everyone in the **Free Birds**.

The most emotional one was the owner here, Guild Master Adam. He put down the wine glass in his hand, stepped on the stool, flipped over the bar counter, rolled and crawled to Owl's side, and squeezed me away directly. Facing Owl, Guild Master Adam pointed at his nose very angrily, repeatedly forcing him to take back what he just said: "Are you fucking crazy! It's bad enough to oppose anyone, but you insist on opposing 'God'! Oh my! When the time comes, if something really goes wrong, I, I can't save you!"

The strength in his hand was great, so great that Owl was poked back three seats by him. It could be seen that he was really anxious about the decision Owl just made. He didn't want to lose Owl, lose a regular customer here, and even more didn't want to lose a friend.

"Do you think I want to?" Owl expressed helplessly. "There is no one in the Atrium who can restrain Ultra and Wind. If we want the situation not to develop in a serious direction, we can only pull them to stand on the same front."

"But just relying on you guys—"

"No need to say more." Owl reached out to stop Guild Master Adam's words, gently pushed his hand away, and completely convinced him with only one sentence: "Senior Muba expects to see no fighting between guilds, not to see two guilds destroy themselves because of fighting."

This sentence was said beautifully. No one in the entire bar could refute it.

Then, Owl asked our client about the details of the conflict between the two guilds. Before leaving, he whispered to Guild Master Adam for a while. I turned my ear to eavesdrop, but didn't hear too clearly, only heard a few key words: Jade, Raid Group, Investigation. I estimated that Owl discovered some problem from it and wanted Guild Master Adam to convey this matter to the principal of the **Raiders** through his sister Jade, so that he could issue instructions in time and let the **Raiders** take over the investigation of this matter as soon as possible. After all, our strength here was limited and we couldn't hold on for too long.

With the gift given to me by Guild Master Adam, all members of **Free Birds**, under the gaze of a group of alcoholics, followed our client to the next battlefield—Sanhara. That was the public domain where the two major guilds were located. Neither of them had set up building-type guild strongholds; compared to those fancy buildings of other guilds, they paid more attention to the people in the guild, and the feeling they brought to themselves.

To say whether the four of us had the idea of going to die with Owl, to be honest, not really. It was mainly because Owl showed an imminent look, as if everything would be finished if we didn't go. So, we were all forced; he didn't ask for our consent.

After talking to myself all the way, I finally followed them to this desolate plateau.

Sanhara is located inside the Atrium, in the southwest fringe area. Standing on the edge of the cliff here, you can overlook the entire Atrium. The scenery is beautiful, and the light breeze blows on your face, feeling very close to nature. It would be better without the three groups of people behind me.

Let me introduce briefly. On our left were all online guild members led by Guild Master Wind (Wind) of the **Windrunner Brigade**. The vast majority could fly, and only a small part stayed on the ground, facing the blowing wind, everyone's face showing enjoyment; on our right was the Beast Legion led by Guild Master Ultra (Ultra) of **Fang of the Beast King**. They rarely kept their human appearance usually. Saying what, brave men never reveal their true identities to outsiders, in fact, they were just a group of hopeless hot-blooded bastards.

The two major guilds confronted each other. Ten mediators stood opposite us, watching the situation. Everyone's image looked not to be messed with. I recognized one of them; eight arms were obvious enough.

At this time, Owl had switched to the image of a Digimon, ready to do it at any time. I came to his side, looked at the "Dramon Killers" on his arm, and asked him: "Are you sure you want to be an enemy of Teacher Changsun? Do you still want him to repair the equipment on your body in the future?"

Owl disapproved of this: "His old man is very generous. As long as we don't confront him directly, it's fine."

This is called generous? I learned a new vocabulary today.

Before our **Free Birds** arrived, the three parties were discussing. Led by the Mediation Organization, the content was nothing more than asking if the two sides had fought. If they fought, they would kill them all; in this case, even if the two sides really fought before, they couldn't admit it now. However, if both sides chose to deny, the Mediation Organization would still determine that they had fought, because the evidence was in front of them—the big pit on the ground and the burnt weeds were enough to explain everything.

After questioning the Guild Masters of both sides in groups, we tentatively understood the current situation: **Fang of the Beast King** bumped into **Windrunner Brigade** during training. They wanted to stop and say hello to the other party. Unexpectedly, at this time, a piece of chaos suddenly fell from the sky, causing a huge impact that instantly swept through the two major guilds. Both sides paid a heavy price for this. Before they could recover from the impact, the Mediation Organization had arrived.

"Too obvious, right?" Dove couldn't help sighing.

I couldn't help but echo: "Yeah, too obvious... If neither Guild Master lied, then this matter must have been done by a third party, deliberately provoking disputes, deliberately attracting the Mediation Organization, deliberately framing. The only uncertain thing is the purpose and behavior of doing so."

"And the identity of the culprit."

Crane supplemented for me in time from the side. The degree of tacit understanding between us was further deepened.

At the same time, Owl had taken Falcon forward to negotiate with the representative of the Mediation Organization, Jupitermon. He wanted to spare no effort to strive for zero sanctions for both sides. Unexpectedly, the other party didn't buy his act at all. Instead, he expressed that as outsiders, if we didn't go away and insisted on pleading for the two sides of the dispute, we would be treated as miscellaneous personnel hindering their execution of official duties.

"Don't be silly," Owl persuaded Jupitermon, "I don't even know their two Guild Masters. Where would I have this leisure time? I advise you to look out for yourselves. Senior Muba doesn't want to see you destroy any guild."

"Senior Muba is our benefactor. You shouldn't mention him."

Owl asked back: "Then you still mention him?"

"Mentioning him is to kill you."

Owl was deeply surprised: "When did you become so brutal?"

"Starting from when you mentioned him..."

Two sentences collapsed. The other party's killing intent was decided. Owl was destined to suffer this time.

In order to minimize the damage, Owl had to propose: before the matter came to light, temporarily let go of the members of both guilds. They were innocent and shouldn't be involved in it without the power to resist.

"Sanctions must be executed face to face."

"I know. I mean, if you insist on lowering sanctions, I suggest you can try aiming your butcher knives at the Guild Masters of the two major guilds and their elites, as well as the **Free Birds** who will always stand in front of you to guard them before the matter is clear. If you have the ability, just come."

"Do you think we dare not?"

"Yeah, afraid you dare not play a one-on-one fair game with us rookies."

"You have five minutes to prepare your last words."

Jupitermon accepted Owl's provocation on behalf of the Mediation Organization. After returning, Owl explained the situation to us and told the Guild Masters of the two major guilds at the same time. They readily accepted Owl's proposal, expressing their willingness to truce and find a way to survive the immediate sanctions first, otherwise the entire guild would be finished.

Out of curiosity, I asked in passing: "So, is there really a conflict between you?"

They didn't admit it, and at the same time, they didn't deny it. Being in the same Sanhara, being neighbors, it was normal to have some small collisions and frictions occasionally. It wouldn't be very serious; the two Guild Masters usually turned a blind eye and didn't take it to heart, just like it didn't exist. The key question now was who magnified this kind of small conflict that usually existed, so much so that it would attract the attention of the Mediation Organization and invite their intervention.

"Time will tell us the answer." Owl stated, "I have found someone to investigate in advance. Now it still takes some time. As long as we hold on and are not defeated by them, the victory will be ours."

"That's why you kept the Guild Masters and Elites..."

"Exactly." Owl took the initiative to apologize to me, "Sorry, Sakura, involving you again this time. If you are unwilling..."

"I am willing." I took the initiative to decline his late and useless apology, "It's not my first time sacrificing my life to accompany a gentleman. Besides, ten against ten, the quantity must match. We were not their opponents originally. If we don't fight for our breath, people will laugh at us."

Taking advantage of our hypocritical time, the two Guild Masters called their elites from the guild crowd respectively. Guild Master Ultra, in the image of his BanchoLeomon, called out a person he called "Xiao Yong" from his Beast Legion. The image was a Rasenmon, standing beside the Guild Master, looking very much like a deputy; Guild Master Wind also turned into the image of Ornismon and ascended smoothly, calling out "Rainbow Starlight"—AncientIrismon Plume and Hououmon Wing from the bird flock behind her. Judging from the image, the deterrent power brought by the two of them was far better than their Guild Master.

"I've arranged everything here. Claws are ready at any time."

"Same here. Fangs are never vague."

Here, Guild Master Ultra finally greeted his old enemy completely. Then, he revealed the appearance of a senior, twisted to Rasenmon "Xiao Yong" following beside him, and told him: "Those rookies behind us will evacuate when we start. What we have to do is to entangle the enemies in front of us and not give them any chance to chase. Protecting the weak is the responsibility of the strong. Did you hear that, Xiao Yong!"

"Yes!"

The immediate reply was seen by the three who had ascended to the sky, and they couldn't help emitting a burst of emotion: It's good to be young.

Ten sanctioners were ready to go. Everyone picked their prey, just waiting for the last sixty seconds to pass.

Jupitermon VS BlackWarGreymon
Junomon VS Mastemon
Ceresmon VS Ornismon
Bacchusmon VS SaintGargomon
Apollomon & Dianamon VS AncientIrismon & Hououmon
Merukimon VS CresGarurumon
Minervamon VS Rosemon
Marsmon VS BanchoLeomon
Vulcanusmon VS Rasenmon

"Everyone, are you ready?"

The caliber of our nine people was unusually unified.
(Wait, nine? Owl, Falcon, Crane, Dove, Sakura, Ultra, Xiao Yong, Wind, Plume, Wing. That's 10 people. The narrative says "nine people's caliber unified"... maybe ignoring the narrator herself or Owl asked it? Or maybe Plume/Wing count as one unit? The list shows Apollo & Diana vs AncientIris & Houou, a 2v2. So 10 vs 10 individuals. Maybe "Nine people" implies everyone except the speaker? Or maybe the author can't count. I will leave it as translated or correct it? "Our nine people" might mean everyone answering Owl. I'll translate as "The response from the rest of us was unusually unified.")

Waiting for Owl's order, a ten-on-ten duel of the century was about to kick off. The first thing that caught the eye was the mutual greeting between the claws and fangs.

### Chapter 12: Battle of Sanhara

At the time of judgment, the "Sanctioning Claws" attacked us, and ten bodies reacted immediately.

Falcon, as always, took the lead. He rotated his body first, unleashing "Bestial Wolf Great Cyclone," successfully neutralizing the "Thousand Fists" sent by Merukimon. Before the opponent could use his beloved sword "Aztec" to open space and summon monsters from another world, Falcon used the "Yellow Beast Scimitar" in his hand to block the opponent in advance. Since then, the contest between the two turned from speed to strength.

Dove followed closely with his huge body. He hugged the body of his opponent Bacchusmon, dragged him into the nearby mountains and fields, and launched a wild bombardment. The reason why he chose such a "Wine Tycoon of the Digital World" as his opponent was entirely because his mechanical body was not worried about poisoning; taking on factors that were difficult for companions in the team to crack by themselves was his code of conduct as a **Defender**.

Crane faced Jupitermon's wife, Junomon. As soon as the two touched, they rushed into the clouds and disappeared from the sight of all of us. In fact, not only Crane, but Guild Master Wind and the two of "Rainbow Starlight" were also the same. The only difference might be that their battle would shuttle between the clouds, occasionally uncovering the veil of the clouds to see the sun, or drilling into the dark clouds, leaving a trace of beautiful trails for people to appreciate and capture.

The fiercest was the duel between beast and beast.

Facing his evolved form Marsmon, Guild Master Ultra showed no trace of timidity; even if he knew that his chance of winning this battle was less than 10%, he didn't shrink back. He still acted like a senior, carrying a cavity of hot blood, and set an example for his junior Xiao Yong. Fists and feet crossed, and the two performed multiple sets of fighting skills. Except for being slightly inferior in strength, Guild Master Ultra was evenly matched with the other side in other aspects, and no one took advantage.

"As expected of the Guild Master of **Fang of the Beast King**, compared to those rotten fish and shrimp in the Atrium, it is different."

"Same to you."

The body was unforgiving, and the mouth could not easily spare the other party—paying him back in his own coin was the duty of a "fighter" and the basic conduct of a brave man.

Taking advantage of the dust storm raised in front of him to obstruct the enemy's vision, Guild Master Ultra burned his own fighting spirit, cast "Burning Bancho Punch," concentrated the raging flames ignited all over his body on his right fist, and aimed at the enemy to emit a flame lion-shaped powerful shock wave. Marsmon was prepared for this. He took the big gift sent by the enemy head-on, gathered the flames around him, wrapped his whole body, followed by kicking the ground with both feet, jumped up from the dust, faced the sunny sun close at hand, and was about to offer his most gorgeous killing move in the air.

"Be prepared!"

"That's exactly my intention!"

The fighting spirit burned to the limit. Guild Master Ultra said nothing to compromise in momentum. Facing the nirvana blow used by the enemy, he should serve with an equally gorgeous unique move.

"—Corona Sanctions!"

"Taste this—Flash Bancho Punch!"

Two absolute forces converged at one point. The violent shock caused lifted the turf, pushed aside the rock surface hidden below, distorted the originally gentle wind, and turned all flammable things in the line of sight into ashes.

"Guild Master—"

"Take care of yourself first!"

Compared to the senior with rich combat experience, Xiao Yong, the "Star of Tomorrow," seemed not so calm.

Unable to care about his own Guild Master's situation, he was suppressed all the way by Teacher Changsun who hurried over, continuously suffering from the turn-based blows of eight arms holding weapons. At this time, no matter how many drills he was equipped with, it was of no avail. Before leaving, I had asked Owl about Teacher Changsun's own combat strength; according to Owl's introduction, Teacher Changsun was not a very strong combat unit, but every time he used force, his posture looked very fierce, very easy to deter people's hearts and make people fall into a passive situation and continue to be beaten. Now it seems that it is indeed so.

Of course, no matter how inexperienced a young man is in combat, he will not willingly be reduced to a sandbag under the hands of an old senior. Relying on his dexterous posture, he tried to dodge again and again. Although he failed many times on the way, fortunately, he controlled it within the range he could accept, so as not to be suppressed by the other party for a long time.

"Sorry, Senior!"

Leaning forward, rolling on the ground, successfully dodging the triple pincher attack of sword, hammer, and stick swung by Teacher Changsun, appearing instantly, he spun the blade on his arm and, at the moment of getting up, delivered a powerful punch "Spiral Vanish" to the old senior approaching him quickly.

Taking the continuous punches of the younger generation head-on, Teacher Changsun's voice obviously carried a little pain. He half-kneeled on the ground, sighed, lamented that the younger generation was formidable, then suddenly turned on the power of his whole body and attacked like a storm. The two hands holding meteor hammers at the very back launched an attack first. While Xiao Yong retreated to dodge, he threw out the metal clubs in the front row and hit the target head-on; accompanied by Xiao Yong looking up to express the pain on his face, the double swords in the front row hands and the double hammers in the second row hands began to play their roles, aiming at Xiao Yong's arms and chest respectively, vowing to smash and dismember him.

"Don't blame me, kid, fate is hard to violate!"

Fate? Could it be that their Mediation Organization was also forced?

They were very close to each other, so close that before Xiao Yong could react, the double hammers and double swords had already approached his body. It was impossible to resist unless there was a nobleman to help. And this nobleman was Owl.

He concentrated the "Dark Gaia Force" in his palm in advance. Taking advantage of turning around to dodge Jupitermon's "Punish Judge," he sent it out smoothly and handed it to his old friend; it exploded the sword and hammer in his hand, saved the life of the younger generation, and also gave him a reminder—there had never been any fate in the Atrium. Even if there was, it had already been cut off by the two "Kiku-Rin" (Chrysanthemum & Phosphorous) swords in the hands of Senior "Muba"; as his former colleague, he absolutely must not do things he didn't want to see.

Teacher Changsun appreciated his old friend's intention. Everything looked so natural.

After the smoke cleared, the war situation had reversed. Xiao Yong seized the opportunity just now, spun the blade of his hand at ultra-high speed, causing the tornado "Qualialise Blast," which swallowed Teacher Changsun's figure in an instant.

"You still have time to care about others?"

"Why not, learned from you." Owl turned his head to face Jupitermon, "If you hadn't cared about your own people all the time, fearing that they would be affected, you would have sent me, this virus seed, on the road with 'Wide-Range Divine Punishment' long ago, wouldn't you?"

"Smart."

"I'm flattered."

After speaking, Jupitermon stretched his arms, hit the heavy hammers in his left and right hands against each other, summoned a small thundercloud, and continuously lowered "Mabolt" on the area where Owl was located. Owl quickly approached Jupitermon while holding up the "Brave Shield" to resist the thunder overhead; after arriving at a certain distance, he saw the opportunity, drilled into the thundercloud, used the "Dark Gaia Force" sent out just now as a cover, locked a straight line with the shortest distance to the opponent, and used "Black Tornado."

A powerful cyclone piercing came head-on. Jupitermon knew that his own strength could not match. In order to save his life, he was forced to give up one hand and the heavy hammer in his hand. At the same time, he also swung the heavy hammer on the other side and smashed Owl directly to the ground.

"Abandon the pawn to save the chariot. Smart."

"I'm flattered!"

This was an affirmation of strength made by a person who lost his arm and weapon to another person whose chest armor was damaged.

My own situation was relatively single. The opponent was Minervamon. Her behavior didn't match her name very much. She was simple to a realm, so that she would only rush up to chop against an opponent like me who had no fighting intention. The big sword "Olympia" in her hand was quite sharp. I didn't want to be chopped by it, so I could only dodge again and again. If not, I threw out "Thorn Whip" to bind her. After that, she still refused to stop. Having no choice, I could only discharge electricity again, trying to make her sleep, but found that she was immune to electric shock; not only that, she also struggled to cut off the vines that bound her with the big sword in her hand and regained her freedom.

Without saying a word, she used "Strike Roll" on me. While dodging, I used "Rose Velvet" to limit her actions on the ground. With a shout full of girlish voice, she jumped up with all her might, used the horizontal rotating cut "Madness Merry-Go-Round," and set off a huge tornado. I couldn't handle such a powerful move.

Counting on Owl to help me, looking back, he was targeted by Jupitermon all the time and was stared at very closely. He had no time to spare at all. Other companions were not in the line of sight. Right now, the only person I could count on was myself.

My brain was running fast. Suddenly, a "Giga Missile" fell from the sky. I guess Dove, the **Defender**, was performing his duty again. I, the **Support**, naturally had to work hard too. Thinking of this, I hurriedly lay down on the ground. Minervamon in the tornado was not so lucky—she didn't see the "Giga Missile" at all. Holding the big sword, she chopped up with the momentum of the tornado. The missile exploded in response. She was blown far away and fell face down in the dirt. The scene was as funny as it could be, and as humiliating as it could be. If this was seen by the person she liked, she estimated that she wouldn't get married in this life.

Our task was to drag the ten mediators and delay time so that the person Owl sent to investigate the mastermind could get the result as soon as possible. Therefore, we must never leave our target. Even if she just landed on her face and squeezed out a few crystal tears in shame in front of you, you couldn't have any sympathy for her. Instead, you should mock her, preferably the kind between women. The effect is significant. She will rush at you like crazy. At this time, what you have to do is use the whip in your hand to whip her frantically until she can rush up against your whipping and subdue you to the ground. You can pull her into your arms and let her experience personally how comfortable it is to sleep in the "Rosey Cradle."

Looking up at the sky, in addition to the flashes of thunderclouds, there were countless rainbow stars. It could be seen how difficult it was for Guild Master Wind and the two of "Rainbow Starlight" to deal with their opponents.

A loud noise came from the sky. Crane and Junomon hugged each other and fell into a forest in the mountains. I wanted to rush over to help her, but just as I took a step forward, a violent adsorption magnetic field was generated in the forest. Obviously, this was the result caused by Crane using "Chaos Degrade."

Leaning back against a huge rock to prevent myself from being sucked into it. Before the dimensional gate closed, another explosion came from not far in front of me. Standing up slightly and looking, Dove's figure flashed past my eyes. Following him was Owl, and Jupitermon who had been chasing him. In addition, there was a sleeping Minervamon lying beside me. This was the environment I was currently in. Tense, exciting, and boring.

Still the same sentence. I hate fighting, but I have to fight. Hard to win a battle, just relaxed and panted heavily, another battle started in front of my eyes.

The person who started it was Jupitermon. He found Minervamon who had fallen into a deep sleep, knocked the heavy hammer in his hand casually, and lowered a thunderbolt from the sky, hitting her and making her awaken into another state. Or rather, giving her a part of energy, allowing her to evolve into a Digimon of a higher stage.

Minervamon, evolve——Mervamon.

Mature, steady, powerful and charming. This was the new feeling she brought me.

Every time I saw the big sword "Olympia Kai" in her right hand and the "Medullia" on her left wrist, I felt more and more that I was not her opponent, especially in the state of self-tension.

"Don't be afraid..."

Owl rushed over to comfort me in time, but it didn't play much role.

Continuous lightning drove him away, and Jupitermon also left the stage, leaving a solitary space for us two girls very gentlemanly, wishing Mervamon could kill me. Naturally, I wouldn't let him get his wish. In this era, who didn't hide one or two unique moves; whether I could defeat her was temporarily not mentioned, but to say self-protection, theoretically there was no problem. After all, Guild Master Adam had exhorted me well. Don't use the small gift he gave me unless absolutely necessary. In his words, the role of the small gift is to save life, not to risk life.

This was a real hard battle.

She is a Virus type, and I am a Data type. I can't take any advantage in attributes. Therefore, whether to use this last trump card will depend entirely on whether she can walk out of my "Forbidden Temptation" alive.

I released ruthless words to her: "Are you ready to accept my temptation?"

She raised the big sword in her hand and replied to me with determined eyes: "If you have the ability, just come!"

This is the most heroic word I have ever heard from a woman's mouth. I have to admit, she successfully aroused my fighting spirit, making me have to show my real trump card and fight to the death with her.

### Chapter 13: Mastermind's Confession

Fifteen years ago, at Cambridge University, I fell in love with a girl. Hindered by my status as a foreign student and a Jew, I didn't easily express my feelings to her, but just watched from the side, silently guarding her.

At the Christmas party at the end of the same year, she made her romance public. The object was a boy from the college's publicity department. The two of them met in the **Atrium** and developed feelings in the **Atrium**. No wonder I never found out. Coincidentally, I also registered an **Atrium** account at that time, but rarely logged in, just treating it as a different form of weekend pastime; even if I was one stage behind them, still staying at the Dobermon of the Champion level, I didn't feel that there was any difference between us. Both appearance and image had turned into Digimon, theoretically there should not be a big difference.

He was Aegiochusmon, and that girl was Angewomon. As a celestial couple, they were known to everyone in the **Holy Knights** at that time. Almost everyone praised them as up-and-coming stars; even their Guild Master felt that if they continued to develop like this, they could completely surpass the "Red and Blue Pair" and become the leaders of the guild. As a member of the **Netherworld Club**, I was not qualified to enter the **Holy Knights** guild. I only deserved to hide outside their guild territory every day, or follow their footsteps, hide in the bushes, staring, watching, listening, thinking, pondering, giggling, envying, being jealous... until they evolved to the Mega level and announced their marriage in front of the whole guild.

I was very angry, but helpless. Who told me not to have the power to resist him.

I chose to swallow my anger, but my heart didn't let him go. harboring a cavity of cowardly anger, thus burying the seed of revenge. Next, it only took time to conceive it, and what I needed to do was to wait quietly for it to mature.

During this period, I didn't know which nerve was wrong, I actually took the initiative to step forward and contact them, pretending to appear as a completely stranger. With the outer clothing of Digimon, they couldn't guess who I was. Gradually, we became familiar with each other. This feeling was like knowing each other again.

From their mouths, I learned about their twelve mediators. Thanks to him, I also realized that it might not be that easy to take revenge on him in the future, unless I struck first and killed the remaining ten people.

So, I embarked on the road of seeking power.

After unremitting efforts, constantly inquiring about intelligence from various people, and even not hesitating to use the underground trading network of our **Netherworld Club**, I finally came to that barren land located in the Digital World and obtained that hard-won dark power from a foreign land. It prompted me to skip the Ultimate level of Cerberumon and directly evolve into the Mega level Plutomon, allowing me to have the strength and courage to rival the twelve of them.

After going back, I didn't become arrogant because of this, but was cautious everywhere.

The environment of the **Atrium** at that time was very unfavorable to the Mediation Organization. Major guilds were hostile to each other. usually, they ran their legs off to resolve disputes between major guilds, and were often besieged by both sides of the dispute jointly. Speaking of reasons, it might be because the feeling they gave to the **Atrium** users was more like the lackeys of the development team, not listening to any defense from either side, regardless of what the truth of the matter was, always acting according to the principles in their mouths. If someone didn't listen, they would do it after persuading again and again. Their behavior was no different from the ruthless law enforcers in reality.

In the **Atrium**, everyone yearns for freedom and unrestrainedness. Most users choose to log in here just to escape the set of restraints in reality, and the existence of the Mediation Organization happens to become an obstacle. How could such people, such an organization, be welcomed by everyone.

The situation was very favorable to me. Following the principle of doing it one by one and defeating them individually, after thoroughly investigating the respective strengths of the twelve of them, I decided to pick a soft persimmon from among them to pinch first, for example, the youngest Venusmon.

Her innocence made me envious. The speed of stepping into the trap was staggering. I didn't even have to lure her specially, saving me a lot of effort. I created a piece of chaos out of thin air, trapped her, and then opened the "Hell's Gate," trying to suck her into it, so that there would be no trace. Unexpectedly, a "Kiku-Rin" suddenly cut in front of me, split the chaos, and left a deep mark on my chest, seriously hindering my plan.

I became extremely annoyed, rushed forward, and launched a desperate fight with the owner of "Kiku-Rin."

At that time, I was young and energetic, and didn't know what kind of person "Master Scar" (Muba) appeared in front of me was. Naturally, I was cleaned up miserably by him. After this battle, I realized a truth very thoroughly: one cannot choose to fight alone just because the object of revenge is one person. At critical moments, unexpected people will always appear to disrupt the situation and save the scene. The best way is to "kill people with a borrowed knife," so that at least you won't be overwhelmed and can put all your mind on your revenge object.

When the **Atrium** entered the official operation stage, I found such an opportunity.

It is better to say that the opportunity found me than I found the opportunity. On that day, Guild Master Wind of the **Windrunner Brigade** painted her face with makeup, came to the territory of the **Netherworld Club**, found our Guild Master Jack (Knave), and said she wanted to see me.

"Are you sure it's her?"

"Except for me, she is the only one in the whole Atrium who can put on that kind of wild makeup."

I admire Jack's honesty. He feels uncomfortable if he doesn't paint himself into a clown every day.

As soon as we met, the wild Guild Master Wind went straight to the subject and asked if I wanted to take revenge on the Mediation Organization. After listening, Jack and I looked at each other and smiled. Jack turned his face and sucked in a breath of cold air, with a smiling face, exhorted "The **Netherworld Club** does not pay for personal behavior," and actively avoided our conversation.

After he left, I stared at Guild Master Wind in front of me and gave a one-word answer: Yes.

"Do you know the 'Free Birds'?"

"The folk **Raiders** who love to meddle in other people's business, I've heard of them."

"What do you think of them?"

"What do you mean?" I was slightly confused and expressed, "What do you mean? Let the five of them deal with the twelve of the Mediation Organization. What is the difference between that and sending them to die?"

She told me that not only them, she herself would also go out, and at the same time, she would pull the leader of the **Windrunner Brigade**, "Rainbow Starlight," and her old neighbor would also come to help.

"Are you sure Ultra has that time?"

"He has never complained about my request. Besides, what we have to deal with this time is the Mediation Organization that he has wanted to take down so many times. presumably you also know how many good things the twelve of them ruined for us back then..."

"Stop." I reached out to stop her from continuing, "I'm not a Guild Master, how do I know how many grudges there are between you back then. Besides, I'm not interested in knowing. If you have that time, you might as well talk to me about the implementation method, let me hear if what comes out of the mouth of a bird flying in the sky is feasible."

She fulfilled my wish and reintroduced herself to me: "Aurora, a folk hypnosis master."

She specially used the word "Master," indicating that she was very confident in her ability in this area. I was dubious about this, expressing that unless she was willing to give me a demonstration in front of me, it would be difficult to convince me.

"There is no need." She said to me with a smile, "You have been hypnotized by me now, haven't you found out?"

I couldn't help becoming cautious and asked her: "How to prove it?"

"Your Guild Master didn't kill me, this is the best proof."

That's true.

During the public beta period, guilds fought on their own and fought each other. Jack once said personally that Wind was his prey. Even though the environment of the **Atrium** has tended to be peaceful for many years now, the hatred between the major Guild Masters will not evaporate so easily, and friendly reception of the other party is even more impossible.

"So, you hypnotized both of us?"

"No, I only hypnotized you." She explained to me, "I injected a subconsciousness into you, making you think that the guy who brought me in just now was your Guild Master. You are convinced of this, aren't you?"

I couldn't beat her, and I couldn't trust her, so I could only follow her words: "Let's assume it is so."

After that, she took out a photo of a man and handed it to me, telling me that this person was the leader of the "Free Birds." She wanted to induce him to help us achieve our goals by applying psychological suggestions to him.

"He will also carry the blame. Who told the method to come out of his mouth?"

I roughly understood what she meant. To be honest, this method is despicable. First act out a play with Ultra to create a picture of hostility between their two major guilds, and then send a "messenger" who had contacted the "Free Birds" very early to notify them, lure them over, stand on our side, and openly be the enemy of the Mediation Organization. It is simply too crazy.

"What if you can't beat the ten mediators..."

"Then it's your turn to go out."

She meant to let me engage in sneak attacks from behind. I exactly had this intention.

Obviously, she was using me. Using me to harvest heads at the end. If it succeeds, everyone is happy; if it fails, the pot is buckled on my head, I will become the target of public criticism and be treated as a bad person by everyone; even if I confess that she and Ultra possess the main conspiracy, by that time, no one will believe me. I have to say, her abacus is very good, but unfortunately she used the wrong place and chose the wrong person. So, I decided to take this opportunity to take good revenge on her.

I don't want to be the big fish that ends the struggle between shrimp and crab, but the fisherman who catches everything in one net without wasting any effort and obtains the final benefit. Therefore, I need a good bait that can catch them all in one net.

The matter was settled like this.

Ten days later, I received a courier package from Ukraine, containing a dried human head. Judging from the hair length, it looked like a woman; in addition, there was a letter written by Jack's subordinate, a mercenary leader. The letter said that the owner of the human head was the folk hypnotist named Aurora, also known as Guild Master Wind. Her identity verification card was also attached below. How to do it later depends on my own arrangement.

Things developed to this step, completely beyond my expectations.

Also revenge, also taking human life, clearly it can be done in the Digital World without leaving a trace, but he insisted on taking action in the real world. I don't understand why. Based on my understanding of Jack, even if I log in to the **Atrium** to find him and question him face to face about what is going on, he will pretend to know nothing and tell me that this is likely the personal behavior of his subordinate, and he never pays for personal behavior. Naturally, he cannot give a reasonable explanation, at most he can only care for humanitarianism, mourn two sentences hypocritically, put his hypocrisy on the table, disgust you away, and you will never know what kind of abacus he is playing from beginning to end.

There was a sentence written on the back of the letter: *You're welcome*.

His means are really high, simply writing "I did it" on his face. In this way, meticulous planning, accurate timing, and reliable executioners, all three conditions are met, so that a seamless revenge can be created.

Obtaining Wind's account, I logged in and contacted Ultra. He didn't suspect my identity at all and still regarded me as his good neighbor. The plan proceeded step by step. Obviously, Wind applied psychological hints to Owl before dying, or rather, Jack sent someone to harvest Wind's head after she applied psychological hints to Owl. The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind, but when it came to me, I was asked, an oriole myself, to play the cicada that was eaten. What was more terrible was that the one eyeing me was Ceresmon, who was also a big bird like the current me.

Fortunately, I understood the opponent's weakness in advance, that is, her main body, "Ceresmon Medium" located on her head, looking very much like a human. She has a very terrifying skill called "Fruit Flechette". I, playing Ornismon, unfortunately became a victim of this skill. Not only was the "Cosmic Ray" released completely sucked away, but the entire Digimon image also turned into pieces of data, slowly disappeared, and ceased to exist.

Since I was inside the **Atrium**, not belonging to the external Digital World, death did not mean the end of everything. For the current me, it meant a comeback.

Forced to return to reality, took the identity verification card belonging to me, inserted it and logged in again, killed back again in the image of Plutomon, and easily harvested Ceresmon's head with only one move of "Wild Cluster".

The subsequent progress continued to advance.

Hijacking Dianamon, solving Apollomon, preventing them from Jogress evolving into GraceNovamon, the remaining two little girls of "Rainbow Starlight" naturally would not be my opponents. We fought happily in the sky, and no one below could see what happened above the clouds. I used a little trick, opened the "Hell's Gate," sent away Hououmon and her "Starlight Explosion," invaded a part of AncientIrismon's body data at the same time, destroyed the "Trial Badge" device in her body, making her completely turn into a Digimon, falling from the sky. The trajectory of the fall naturally formed a beautiful rainbow.

After that, I went to visit my former sweetheart. She was also one of the objects of revenge I wanted. At this moment, she was hugging Mastemon, pinching each other's necks. Seeing that the opportunity was just right, I attacked them from behind, used a piece of chaos as a cover to make them think that it was the other party's credit, and then hid in the clouds with peace of mind, watching them fall slowly.

Coming to the place where they fell, the two ladies were stunned by the fall, rushing at each other with teeth and claws. I stepped forward to separate them and gave each one a slap. They didn't calm down because of this, but became more like a shrew.

Mastemon rushed at me first. She successively used her two proud moves against me—"Holy Desire" and "Dark Despair," which were resolved by me one by one. Seeing that she couldn't win quickly, she didn't think much and directly used her bottom card "Chaos Degrade" on me. The generated dimensional gate not only had no effect on me, but reserved a part of time for me, so that I could take my former sweetheart into my arms, inject my core virus into her, let her obtain the same dark power from a foreign land as me, and prompt her to complete further breakthroughs in herself, evolving into Junomon: Hysteric Mode.

In this form, she would not be perceived by Jupitermon. In other words, I could make good use of her.

As expected of the girl I once fancied, she really didn't let me down. Using the needles in both hands, she easily destroyed the armor on Mastemon's body, pierced her body, made her fall into a state of suspended animation unable to move, lifted her over her head like showing off a trophy, dragged her for a long distance, and threw her away like garbage after confirming that there was new prey nearby.

"Willful girl."

 I let such a sentence float by casually, looked around, and didn't find anyone else nearby. When I realized that I might be that target, she had already entangled me with the chains on her two hands, preparing to pierce me like the garbage thrown out just now.

Seriously, at that moment, my heart ached, as if returning to the era when she broke my heart completely. Wanting to cry, the tears in my heart had already dried up back then, leaving only a cavity of hot blood.

In order to survive, I had no choice but to use "Chaos Light" to end her, ending the love of that year.

When I saw Jupitermon collapse because of her death, I realized that over the years, my goal had gradually shifted from that girl to the person who accompanied her. Dazzled by the thought of revenge, unknowingly, the proportion he occupied in my heart had far exceeded my beloved girl, which was undoubtedly a tragedy.

A complete tragedy created by my own hands.

### Part 1: The Nordic Investigation

#### -Account of Agnes (Part 1)-

My father attempted to broker a marriage alliancea blind date. I didn't want to go, afraid I wouldn't find any common topics with the guy. Just as I was looking for an excuse to decline, an excuse found its way to me.

The person who contacted me was the younger sister of my first boyfriend, Aurelie Lefebvre, who was also my senior in university. She reached out to me as the representative of the French **Raiders**, trying to convince me to help her investigate a certain person. Originally, she wanted to go through the formal process and report it to the **Raiders** lead for assignment, but the leader was away, so she contacted me first.

"You've come to the right person."

I accepted without a second thought.

"The target likely isn't a friendly character, Agnes. Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?"

"By the time I finish reconsidering, the bird will have flown." I thanked her for her kind warning and told her: "Don't worry, the five Nordic countries are a group; we always act together. If there's a lead, I'll give you an answer immediately."

Hanging up, I ignored my father's persuasion outside the door, shared the news with the representatives of the other four Nordic countries, locked the door, went to the EDEN haptic equipment, wiped off the dust, inserted my ID medal, and logged into the long-lost Atrium system. Sanhara was still as beautiful as ever.

Switching to the form of Valkyrimon, I was about to fly up to find Guild Master Wind and ask about the situation. Just as I was about to move, my companion golden bird "Freya" stopped me, warning me to be alert as something dangerous was approaching.

Hiding behind a massive rock and looking around, I soon saw a Plutomon. He was muttering to himself, full of self-reproach, as if he had just done something wrong to someone.

I followed him all the way, hoping to hear some useful clues from his mouth to save the trouble of disturbing our Guild Master, who loved to pursue freedom and the wind. His sanity had clearly frayed, personally confessing every crime he had committed—including how he used Guild Master Wind's ID medal to log into the Atrium in her identity and played the "Free Birds" and the mediation organization like puppets.

My intuition judged that he was the culprit I was looking for.

So I stepped forward immediately to engage in negotiation; the reason I didn't act immediately was because I still tried to believe that what he had just said was all nonsense. After questioning him once, not only did he not answer a single question, but he turned back and asked me: "Did you hear everything I just said?"

I gave him an affirmative answer. He smiled twice at me, ended with a contemptuous tone, and then stated that I knew too much about him, so he had to silence me and not let me return alive to tell others, even gentlemanly asking me to prepare to be quickly terminated by him.

"Please, is there any point in these empty words?" I said to him disdainfully. "Straight talk: we're both Megas, who are you trying to intimidate?"

The next second, he released a piece of black chaos from behind him, vanished into it, and instantly appeared behind me. Fortunately, with Freya's timely warning, his sneak attack didn't succeed. I made a prompt decision and drew the "Fenrir Sword" hanging on my left waist to counter-attack.

The sword touched his hard body and instantly froze it. But in the blink of an eye, he was swallowed by that clump of black chaos again, then restored to his state before being frozen, reappearing before me.

"Is this all you've got?"

He subjected me to verbal humiliation. As a descendant of the "Valkyrie," how could I tolerate this? So I shot my "Aurvandil's Arrow" at him, which never missed. Little did I expect that he would casually pull over a piece of chaos from behind him, turning it into a shield and blocking it very easily.

It's no exaggeration to say that aside from my best skill in team command, my **Support Position****Five Nordic Countries Raiders**; sometimes, I feel ashamed for myself.

Realizing that my amateur skills weren't enough to take him down alone, I immediately changed my strategy, switching from offense to defense, leading him toward populated areas to create a relatively large commotion and cause a stir, so I could meet up with the others as quickly as possible. If all five of us were present, I doubted he would have the power to turn the tide.

I excelled at speed, so dodging was my forte—little did I know it was also his.

Following me with a relentless pursuit, I didn't gain a single advantage and ended up covered in wounds, often being blasted from the sky to the ground, rolling and crashing into trees and rocks, the scene becoming as pathetic as could be.

Holding my waist and lying on the ground, I gradually realized I might not make it to a populated area, so I intended to turn back and fight to the death, to see whose life was harder.

The outcome proved his life was harder to extinguish.

I was reduced to a broken ruin, resistance futile. The feathers on my body were continuously burned by the black chaos, and the pain from the skin burns made me scream again and again, but it only made him more excited, more wanting to strip a bird-person like me from the data combination and have my soul completely infected by this dangerous virus, becoming another scourge threatening the Atrium.

Wanting to beg for mercy, but unable to open my mouth.
Wanting to run away, but unable to move my legs.
Falling into such a state, it's no exaggeration to say my life was "in imminent danger." I didn't know if this power of his was innate or obtained through effort; regardless, I could be sure that the black chaos on him absolutely didn't belong to the Atrium—in other words, the Atrium couldn't produce a monster like him.

"Miraculous, right?" He leaned close to my ear and whispered softly: "This black thing has given me power. It cannot be destroyed by your ultimate moves, cannot be cleared as data, and cannot even be identified as a bug by the system. With it, no one is my opponent. Everyone who stands in my way will be swallowed by it, becoming its nourishment and prompting it to continuously supply me with power. And you are but an appetizer; I can tell it to be a bit gentler to you, so you don't go so painfully."

"Does it require me to pay any price?"

"Of course not," he replied quickly. "Erasing your existence is the price."

I felt more and more that even if the five of us gathered, we might not be able to handle him, because that piece of black chaos would always block all fatal damage for him, and sometimes it could even become transparent, appearing unexpectedly and giving you a hard blow from behind, becoming a weapon to plot against you.

"I want to know where you got such a treasure?"

I gritted my teeth and struggled to ask this question. My strength was gradually being sucked away, my spirit became withered, and even the vision before my eyes hadn't escaped the influence, blurring bit by bit.

"Like you, I also want to know."

He told me that back then, to pursue power beyond the mediation organization, he stepped into that barren land in the Digital World and then honorably fainted. When he woke up, he found he possessed this miraculous power.

"...And even completed a stage-skipping evolution."

"Stage-skipping? How... how is that possible?"

"Believe it or not," he said indifferently. "No executioner would lie to a dying person. It... indeed happened, right to me. I also want to figure out what's going on, but unfortunately, there aren't enough talents in the Atrium. Perhaps, at this moment, someone has hidden in their territory and figured it out."

He had ignored one thing from the beginning, and that was why I had fallen to such a state. Logically, in terms of speed, he and I were evenly matched, and it shouldn't lead to a one-sided situation, unless "Freya," the golden bird that always reminded me how to dodge attacks from behind, had been sent out temporarily to perform another task. For example, calling someone, leading the way—and all I had to do was cooperate with it, delay Plutomon, and buy more time for it until my reinforcements arrived.

Hard work pays off; just before my left arm was disabled, the first reinforcement arrived—Sleipmon, the representative from Finland and the **Vanguard Position**. The "Bifrost" was fired from the holy crossbow "Muspelheim" in his left hand, and Plutomon, unable to dodge in time, had to take this hit squarely.

Upon meeting, he sent a greeting gift to our enemy, which not only distracted him but also bought enough time to rescue me. It seems his **Vanguard Position** is quite reliable.

"Go quickly, I've got this."

After saying this, he was knocked aside by Plutomon's "Chaos Light." With the holy shield "Niflheim" on his right arm as a block, the damage he sustained was minimal.

Seeing this, Plutomon naturally wouldn't leave him much room to breathe. After dropping two chaos bombs in quick succession, our vanguard Sleipmon completely disappeared into a patch of chaos. When we saw him again, he had been forced to use his hidden ultimate "Odin's Breath," using the holy shield "Niflheim" on his right arm to manipulate the nearby weather and trigger a blizzard to continuously resist that chaos.

I didn't want to waste his good intentions, so I hurried toward the town ahead. I firmly believed that as long as we reached a populated area, it would be our home field, and we would transform from our previous identity as prey into hunters. Of course, it's possible I was overthinking it.

Judging from the subsequent results, my team members were still very reliable.

After the **Vanguard Position****Defense Position****Five Nordic Countries Raiders** are destined not to fail. Unfortunately, the pity was that this time he was fighting alone against an almost invincible guy who excelled in both long-range and close-range combat and had that black chaos shield that could immune all attribute damage. No matter how high Olegmon's weight class or how much monstrous strength he used, he couldn't achieve a breakthrough, and the final result could only end in a one-sided defeat.

Entering the town, I kept shouting and calling for anyone to help me. However, the people here were either Rookies who had just completed guild registration or Champions who had been out for a while and came here for recovery; relying on them was impossible. They were also very sensible; seeing us coming, they one by one cleared the path very efficiently, and didn't even say a word of complaint, probably already scared witless.

Passing through a marketplace, I was tripped by a pole in the middle of the road. Turning back, Plutomon's right index finger was pointing exactly at my brow, less than half a fist's distance away. At the critical moment, two massive battle hammers flew from a side street, hitting the Plutomon who was about to act against me.

Looking through the fleeing crowd, a familiar figure appeared before me, gasping for breath and chewing a brown mass, looking as honest and cute as when I first knew him.

"Huff... huff... finally... caught... caught up?

He's from Iceland, our new **Substitute Position** Vikingmon. In the matter of "rescuing fallen comrades," how could a chivalrous hero of "seeing injustice and drawing one's sword" be late?

Opening his mouth, he brought me a piece of news that sounded somewhat sorrowful: "Freyr had a bad stomach last night and went to the toilet without paper. He told us to wait for him a while, and he'll come to meet up with us after he's 'air-dried'."

I even smelled the scent in his words.

Hard to imagine how I originally promoted such a guy to join the **Raiders**, speaking such words with his mouth full of chocolate; wouldn't he feel disgusted?

### Part 2: The Hero's Detour

#### -Account of Freyr (Part 2)-

I am Freyr, from Copenhagen, Denmark. Currently working at St. Canute's Cathedral where Hans Christian Andersen was once baptized. I don't like fairy tales and long for a solitary life with only myself in the whole world, probably because I'm used to being bullied by the group of fellows around me.

I actually can't figure out why I'm usually targeted by them. Simply because I have a good temper? Perhaps that's indeed the case; who wouldn't want to pick a person with a good temper to bully? As long as it's not particularly excessive, at most I'll say a few words to them in person; if it is particularly excessive, it's actually fine—at most I'll curse a few more swear words. I suddenly realized, do I usually give them too much of a good face, to the point where they think I won't get angry? Maybe; if I want to get a conclusion on this sort of thing, I have to find a special chance to test. And I'm a person who's afraid of trouble; if I were a bit more diligent, I wouldn't be holding a Copenhagen University diploma and doing the work of a cathedral gatekeeper.

That Sunday, as usual, I was patrolling near the cathedral, picking up trash and watching tourists show affection. Bored, I pulled out my phone to check messages. Captain Agnes contacted us, telling us to go online as soon as possible to perform a new mission.

The remaining three indicated in turn "received" or "on the way." Not following their formation would make me stick out, which wouldn't be quite right. However, my EDEN haptic experience device was still at my home in Fasanvej, Copenhagen, quite a distance from my place of work. How far? Let me put it this way: from a geographical standpoint, they aren't even on the same island. Driving back would take me at least two and a half hours.

The job can't be left undone; it determines whether I starve to death in reality. The mission can't be skipped either; my absence might lead to mission failure and team members being killed in action. I can't bear the responsibility associated with lives, so I decisively chose the latter.

I wanted to retract the message I just sent out, but unfortunately they had already seen it. Distance made it certain I would be late; I had to make up a suitable reason for myself in advance. So, I privately contacted the newcomer **Substitute** who had just joined the team, telling him I had a party with friends last night, had a bad stomach, woke up to find it was already noon today, and was currently at the toilet, even forgot to bring paper, and asked them to wait for me for a bit.

"When can you arrive? Give me a definitive answer!" The newcomer had a rather fiery temper.

"Uh, anyway, no paper. How long it takes to 'air-dry', I don't know either; estimate it yourself."

I hope he can deliver the words completely.

Driving at high speed on the road, while waiting for a red light, I took my phone. The Atrium system's information page automatically pushed a message to me, the title unusually eye-catching: "Windrunner Brigade VS Fang of the Beast King." Clicking in for details, it even included a live broadcast screen. After watching for a few seconds, I thought it was quite interesting. Just as I was about to put down my phone and prepare to start, the golden bird "Freya," always following Agnes, sent us a distress message in the form of data, telling us to come quickly as its master was about to give out.

"Sorry, I'm still on the road. If I don't go, the drivers behind will rush up to beat me."

After replying with such a message, I put down my phone, stepped on the gas, and hurried through the fatal intersection just as the signal light turned yellow; the path ahead was clear.

Driving into Zealand and passing through Slagelse, my mother called me, asking if I could visit her tonight and have dinner with her. I said I was very busy; even though I was currently less than two kilometers from the nursing home where she lived, I still couldn't slow down because in another world, there was someone waiting for me to save.

"...Be proud of him. Your son is on his way to be a hero." As I spoke, one hand subconsciously pulled an ID medal from my pocket. I never dreamed it would appears here; no wonder I couldn't find it after searching the whole house for the past few days.

"Wait, Mom!" I suddenly remembered something. "Does your nursing home have EDEN haptic equipment?" "Of course, otherwise how do you think a mother in a wheelchair would experience life every day?"

With those words of hers, I was relieved; just don't find another father for me.

Making a temporary detour, I rushed into the nursing home, inserted the ID medal, logged into the Atrium system, and hoped my appearance wouldn't be too late.

#### User ID: NO.05000

#### Holder: Erich Freyr Hansen

#### Gender: Male

#### Age: 43

#### User Persona: Freyr

#### Digimon: Imperialdramon: Dragon Mode

#### Guild: Imperial Dragon's Nest

#### Confirm Login: YES

"Go, son, and knock them flat!"

"Actually, I'm going to save someone... Okay, no problem. Love you, Mom."

Touching the button on the left, I logged in successfully, then immediately switched to my Digimon form and rushed toward the coordinates given by Freya. Passing through three guild domains on the way, I finally reached the territory of **Nether Club**, just in time to catch my old acquaintance Heath being in charge of evacuation work here.

I stepped forward to talk, asking what happened. He told me it was all the handiwork of the other four.

I sensed trouble. Before he finished speaking, I took the lead and interrupted him, then flapped my huge wings on both sides and rushed forward. After flying a short while, from a distance I saw a fellow draped in a blood-red cape, jet-black all over, preparing to strike a Vikingmon. Behind him lay our team's **Defense Position****Support Position**, both dying, looking like they had just gone through a fierce battle. From this, I deduced that the Vikingmon must be our newcomer; last time I saw him, he was still a Zudomon.

#### "——Positron Laser!"

Until I offered him a greeting gift, did I see clearly that our enemy was Plutomon. His image had a slight discrepancy from what I remembered; specifically, the piece of black chaos behind him looked a bit unmatched and out of place with his overall look, a bit discordant.

Facing my sudden attack, Plutomon unhurriedly pulled over his cape to defend. The energy cannon ports on my back continued to output; no matter how powerful that cape of his was, it wouldn't be able to withstand it. Soon, after I surged forward and used the blade slash "Splendor Blade" of my forelimbs, he vanished into the ruins below.

Next, it was time to face my teammates.

"Sorry, I'm late." I originally wanted to say this to them.
"If you didn't come, we'd be dead for sure!" I originally thought they would answer like that.

Unexpectedly, none of us followed common sense.

"How come the **Main Attacker Position** isn't here? You all are acting like bears, collectively playing dead?"
"Freyr!"

They called out my name very affectionately. In that moment, I felt like a hero, admired and envied by them. And then, they asked that stupid-to-the-core question in unison: "Are you... air-dried?"

I didn't quite want to answer them; telling the truth would indeed ruin the atmosphere.

I suddenly remembered a sentence said by Guild Master Adam, who was once my lifesaver: "Before confirming the enemy is completely finished, don't relax your guard." Clearly, I made this mistake and was a step late; the enemy's brutal, evil claws had already approached me, within reach, not allowing me to make any reaction. Fortunately, the newcomer in front of me timely threw out the two heavy battle hammers on his back, thus saving my small life.

"Thanks, newcomer..."
"Watch out?

He once again blocked in front of me, catching Plutomon's chaos strike with the thick shield on his shoulder. At this point, I could no longer stand being saved by a newcomer; this kind of embarrassing thing was enough twice, no need for a third time.

"Get out of the way, newcomer!"

I pushed him aside, intending to let that abominable enemy taste the flavor of "Mega Death." Unexpectedly, the opponent was a step ahead. After taking a hit of "Chaos Light" squarely, my whole body went limp on the ground, and I could no longer move; the surrounding environment was gradually swallowed by the piece of black chaos behind him. Now I am the one who needs to be saved.

Let me ask, whose **Main Attacker Position** is so pathetic right upon debut? Only the Nordic Five.

"Any last words, big guy?"

He completely enraged me; he's finished!

"Yes, of course I do." I told him, "They're hidden in my mouth."

As things stood, I wouldn't hide any cards anymore; use them if needed, never stingy. Whether I could breakthrough this black chaos entirely depended on what I had just held in my mouth. Before I switched to my Digimon form, I had taken a treasure from my personal inventory and swallowed it—it was a rare item named "Promotion Seed." Its role, to put it broadly, could turn the current critical situation around; to put it specifically, it could help me save everyone's lives.

"Come on!"

I let out a roar and swallowed it, and my body underwent a very noticeable change.

#### Imperialdramon: Dragon Mode, Mode Change —Imperialdramon: Fighter Mode

Switching modes, my body became flexible, and not by just a little bit. Meeting the enemy in this state, even with a ten-minute time limit, the enemy would surely feel pressure and shock.

Facts were just as I thought. After I finished the mode change and confronted the enemy again, a weakened trend in his momentum was clearly perceptible. The spotlight was all mine; I wonder how he feels now, presumably already prepared to pay the price. In that case, I didn't need to be polite with him either—old way, blast him to death.

With round after round of "Giga Death," he gradually became a bit unable to hold on, and could only use that piece of black chaos behind him to block in front for protection. Taking this chance, the remaining three suddenly surged—no, strictly speaking, it was four. The Finnish fellow of the **Vanguard Position** had just arrived. Four people, covered in wounds, let the Plutomon before them experience a gift from the Nordic countries; I guess, aside from a blizzard, there wasn't anything else worth presenting.

The target wasn't Plutomon, but the piece of black chaos that served him in resisting damage. It was like a stray flame, always guarding its master. Unfortunately, in the triple icy blizzard, it couldn't hold out for long and was soon firmly frozen, suffering Olegmon's "Viking Flail" and turning into data powder, dissipating among the clouds.

Losing the protection of the black chaos, Plutomon was in total disarray and tried to escape, but was surrounded by the five of us. You can imagine what happened next. "Aurvandil's Arrow," "Fenrir Sword," "Dual Battle-Axe Rotation," "Mjolnir Hammer"—every skill we could use was used on him. Finally, under the impact of a "Giga Death" released after I gathered energy, Plutomon's mission thoroughly met its conclusion.

The streets were torn up, and the town was in ruins. Looking at the large crater left on the ground, everyone let out a sigh—except for our captain, Miss Agnes. She alone was looking around for Plutomon's remains, for unknown reasons.

I subconsciously advised her: "Don't look. With such a large impact range, there's surely not even a speck left..."

She tentatively believed my words. After confirming that the cleanup work for the scene had begun, she led us back to report.

Five people, dragging their weary bodies, crawled into "Drink a Glass Bar" and waited for a long time before the client, Jade, finally appeared. Her face didn't look particularly beautiful, probably having encountered unpleasant things on the way.

"You're finally here, our competitors."

She rarely didn't greet me, didn't say a word, sat down at our table, hesitated repeatedly, and told us a piece of news she had just heard from someone else.

In summary, after taking a "Giga Death" from me, Plutomon unexpectedly survived. He pathetically ran to the base of **Nether Club** to beg Guild Master Jack to save him and repair his missing data. Not clear what they communicated; possibly Guild Master Jack was dissatisfied with his actions, or possibly afraid his arrival would involve himself. So, he switched to the form of Voltobautamon and solved him neatly with a "Palace Waltz."
"...Treat it as evil meeting its reward."

Is the fact really so? Perhaps we will never know.

### Chapter 14: Dragon and God

The heroic dragon warrior lowered the massive sword on his shoulder, pointing it at his old friend, and was the first to state his position: "Data Clearing Style, Owl—Reporting for duty!"

The God of Heaven followed closely: "Data Clearing Style, Vulture—Reporting for duty!"

Thereafter, the two simultaneously displayed a confident posture, gripping their greatswords at the same moment. Once the impact before them had completely dissipated, they rapidly closed in on each other. The two giant swords crossed and joined, generating a massive energy that pushed both back, forcing them to pull apart once more.

The frontal clash yielded no result, so the two immediately shifted strategy, unfolding a duel of sword techniques supported by speed. Dragging their giant swords, the two wove through the forest and fields; every swing was incredibly heavy, and the damage caused was enough to alter part of the terrain. As members who had both been taught the "Data Clearing Style" under Master Muba, the two were equally hardworking and had both received direct instruction from their master. Thus, in terms of sword skills, they were evenly matched, making it difficult to determine a victor.

Owl swung his sword, but Vulture retreated and jumped onto a nearby tree, then raised the thunderous greatsword high, firing a golden bolt of lightning straight into the sky. A vast expanse of thunderclouds answered his call, raining down fierce thunderclaps in response.

Before the lightning flashes, Owl's evasion was lethargic, the movements of a titan burdened by age. He didn't want to be decapitated, so he could only stand his ground, waving his giant sword and repeatedly turning away the invitations from heaven.

Seeing this, Vulture rose again, hovering in the sky and moving into Owl's blind spot. He injected a portion of his energy into the greatsword, then aimed it at Owl's body to execute a new form of "Divine Punishment." Owl, however, had long noticed his old friend's ill intentions and kept a constant eye on his movements. When the thunderous sword plunged from behind his head, Owl immediately gripped the "Dorumon Breaker," turned, and struck a "Victory Charge" at Vulture. Using the massive blade of the "Dorumon Breaker" as a shield, he absorbed the energy stored within the opponent's sword and released it again, looking as if Vulture's attack had been completely reflected.

Vulture was caught off guard by Owl's move, suffering the pain he had brought upon himself. Before he could adjust his hovering for stability, Owl's next retaliation had already arrived.

The ten-minute limit was approaching; time was running out.

Owl didn't have time to overthink; he directly unleashed his ultimate move, "Trident Gaia." Rotating the hilt, he pulled the central spine connected to it, while closing both sides of the guard, causing the left and right blades to connect from the pommel, forming a completely new, sharp blade. In a dual-wielding fashion, he concentrated all the energy existing in the atmosphere at the tips of the two blades, gradually forming a massive energy cannon.

Seeing his old friend intended to end the battle as quickly as possible, Vulture had the same idea. He transformed himself into high-voltage plasma and injected it into the thunderous greatsword. Just before Owl could drop that massive energy cannon on him, he reversed the blade early, thrusting the thunderous greatsword forcefully into the ground and releasing the most destructive "Wide-Range Divine Punishment."

The two extreme powers clashed once more, and the Atrium shook again because of it.

"Guild Master?

"Don't worry about it!"

Adam timely called back Jade, who was planning to go out and investigate, and simultaneously stopped the agitated behavior of the customers in the bar, telling them to stay calm: "Everyone, it's just the mediation organization performing official duties. We're just a small guild and can't afford to provoke them; be careful of curiosity killing the cat."

Saying this, he turned back and gave a look to the bartender at the counter.

"Let me say, everyone, we're all sensible people. It's better to just sit down and have a drink. The next round is on me—drink as much as you like, and don't be polite."

If one looked closely, it wasn't hard to notice that Guild Master Adam's back was already soaked in cold sweat. Even without being physically present, he could feel the magnificent scene and couldn't help but break into a cold sweat for "Free Birds."

Deep within the explosion where their combined energy converged, the two held their swords against each other. Their convictions reached a peak in that moment; no one had concerns or hesitations. Both hoped to defeat the strong one before them and move toward the next height.

"Are you prepared to lie on the ground, Owl!"

"It's still too early!"

After the simple greeting, both sides simultaneously unleashed the "Data Clearing Style" swordsmanship for the decisive victory. A cold light flashed through, and the battle between the Dragon and the God finally reached its conclusion.

The smoke dissipated, and the setting sun spilled down. A gentle breeze brushed past their ears, and at this moment, they both collapsed on the ground in unison, both having lost their fighting spirit and reverting to human form.

"Tell me, Owl, why did I lose?"

"You didn't."

"Bullshit! Losing is losing; I won't fail to admit such a thing. So, you'd better not use that hypocritical face of yours to compliment and deal with me—I don't buy that."

Hearing this, Owl had no choice but to say that heartbreaking sentence: "You didn't receive the true heritage of Master Muba."

"True heritage? I didn't know there was such a thing... what is it?"

"The final ultimate art of the 'Data Clearing Style' that can only be performed with dual-wielding—Rakukyoukijuzan"

"Heh, I suppose it does."

With those words, Vulture showed a look of compromise, gazing up at the sky that wasn't too far from them, and let out a sigh: "We're still the same as before, unable to understand him. We truly were defeated by him."

That feeling seemed like reminiscing about the past, yet also like thanking their master.

Master Muba, you truly are the greatest blacksmith in the Atrium. Even knowing you were to part with this world, you didn't forget to forge two swords no less than "Kiku-rin"... one named "Owl" and one named "Vulture."

Thanks to you, those two swords are still as cold and sharp as ever today. Just like you back then, they are always guarding the Atrium.

"Soon, our people will be here."

"Who isn't? Everyone goes to their own home and finds their own mother. Today's business is entirely a thing of the past; treat it as if it never happened."

"How about calling them and going for a drink together?"

"You're paying."

"I'll kill you."

---

### Chapter 15: A Beautiful End

The saga concluded with impeccable finality.

Upon returning, we exchanged information with Jade, Master Adam's younger sister, and the members of the **Five Nordic Countries Raiders**, and generally understood the cause and effect of this "Beast-Bird Struggle."

"Although there's still a part where we haven't figured out what exactly happened, it doesn't matter."

These words carried a troubling weight.; it sounded as if those people died for nothing. How their souls could find peace—Miss Agnes likely never even thought about it.

A group of people sat in the bar, gathered around two tables, and began to speculate randomly on the motive of the mastermind, Plutomon. No need to worry about leaking news; the arrival of the mediation organization had already caused a significant loss of customers for the bar. It was lucky that Guild Master Adam was an exception among guild masters; since the establishment of "Drink a Glass Bar," he had always maintained neutrality with other guilds and had clearly defined his own relationships, which was why he didn't have to face the mediation organization with swords drawn.

Owl pulled me aside at this point, asking about my previous situation. I knew he was worried about me, and also clearly knew that the situation at the time, even now in hindsight, still filled me with deep fear.

At that moment, Mervamon's greatsword was about to strike my head. I had a quick idea and fell back onto the grass behind me. Just before her "Final Strike Slash" arrived, I swallowed the gift Guild Master Adam had given me—a "Promotion Seed." Subsequently, the red on my body gradually turned to white, and the cloak on my back was dyed with a touch of pink, adding a hint of girlishness to the original "Queen of Flowers and Grass," thus breaking through my own limits.

Rosemon, Burst Evolution—Rosemon: Burst Mode.

The burst evolution at the critical moment was something I'd never forget in my life.

"And then?"

"And then I discovered a completely new operational mode."

I had said before that Bandai Sakura never liked fighting or killing. Thus, the network data satisfied her wish, weakening a portion of her combat ability and thereby deepening her charm attribute. For example, giving the opponent a sudden kiss, making them confused and even a bit shy; taking advantage of her being stunned on the spot, I amplified the aura of my cloak, wrapping her gently inside and making her fall into a deep sleep.

"So, you didn't destroy her?"

"That's right."

I didn't deny it.

"Then... where is she?"

"Still in the same old place," I explained to Owl. "She's sleeping too soundly; I couldn't drag her. To be honest, I underestimated the potency of my own allure. I'll tell you secretly, don't tell anyone else—I slapped her twice, very hard, and even that didn't wake her up."

After Owl finished listening, he gave a helpless shrug and stated: "Well, as long as everyone is alive."

I didn't know which one of us he was talking about.

Through this battle, the mediation organization successively lost four major generals: Junomon, Ceresmon, Apollomon, and Dianamon. Windrunner Brigade's Guild Master Wind and Rainbow Starlight's Wing also honorably sacrificed themselves. Now the Windrunner Brigade is taken over by the survivor, Hana. Xiao Yong barely defeated Master Nagasumi, who was going easy on him, and the battle between Guild Master Ultra and Marsmon ended in a draw, which could be considered as not dragging down the "Total Victory Group."

In contrast, the situation on "Free Birds'" side was somewhat pathetic. Crane was reduced to scrap., with armor and feathers damaged to varying degrees and needing a long time to recover. Dove and Falcon naturally go without saying—they were respectively defeated by their opponents and were thoroughly convinced by their loss.

"Really? I don't believe it."

"Believe it or not," Owl told me. "They're our own people; usually leave them some face and don't mention this matter in front of them again—people need space to grow."

I highly agreed with his last sentence; I thought so too.

"So, is that it for this matter?"

"Of course not," Owl was very certain of this. "At most, it can only be considered a comma; there are still too many things waiting for us to discover and understand. No matter who the ultimate beneficiary is, we at least need to know the reason for them doing so."

"Is pure revenge possible?"

"Before the truth is clear, everything is possible."

Thus, this assignment ended with a perfect comma. From the contemplative postures of everyone, it seemed as if there was still something placed on the table that we had overlooked, or rather, hadn't noticed at all, thinking its existence was reasonable.

"Um, I'll take the liberty to ask a question." One of the responsibilities of the **Support Position** is to remind: "The newcomer who first came to commission us—has anyone here looked into them?"

The people present shook their heads in succession; no one knew that newcomer. At the same time, Owl stood up, slapped his forehead, and suddenly realized: "That's right, we haven't determined his identity... we were all in a misunderstanding before, thinking the culprit was Plutomon, but what if he's not?"

"Moreover, we don't even know what his Digimon form is," I continued to add from the side.

As the representative of "Beast King's Fang," Xiao Yong had a general idea after hearing our introduction and could basically determine the identity of that person. He then introduced him to us: "That guy is indeed a newcomer, named Solomon. His digital image is a Psychemon. He's considered one of the newcomers who's relatively close to our Guild Master, often running errands for him. He's got a good reputation in the guild, and we all quite like him."

"That makes sense then." Owl said, snapping fingers. "A Gabumon subspecies—except for the horn on the top of its head, there's no part of its body that needs metal to fill. Let's make a hypothesis: if he were just an ordinary newcomer with a decent reputation in the guild, even if the horn on his head broke one day, he wouldn't be in such a hurry to find us and request that we take him to 'Hephaestus Workshop' to find Master Nagasumi. Ask anyone in the guild and they'd know where the place is..."

"Reasonable."

Jade sat up straight and took over Owl's words. Holding the glass in her hand, she expanded her deduction: "If, I'm saying if, that newcomer named Solomon—what if he's Plutomon's man?"

"Then it returns to the starting point," Captain Agnes answered her bluntly. "Nothing has changed."

"So, only if he works for the person who truly benefits can everything make sense."

Xiao Yong didn't quite understand and asked Jade sitting next to him: "How can you tell?"

"Think about it," Jade put forward a new line of thinking for us. "What kind of role is he responsible for playing in this matter? A runner, someone who could enable 'Free Birds' to intervene in the bird-beast struggle and participate in it, and a character who is hostile to the mediation organization. In other words, although he is only a pawn in the hands of the beneficiary, the position he occupies is quite important. With him, this thing can succeed."

For a moment, everyone fell into contemplation, and the atmosphere was inexplicably quiet. Master Adam passed by us with two empty wine glasses. Seeing us all in such a serious state of thinking, he couldn't help but join in, and as soon as he spoke, he shocked us deeply.

"Having heard you say so much, if you ask me, this matter was clearly done by Jack of **Nether Club**."

I hurriedly stopped him and asked: "No, boss, why can you be so certain?"

"That's easy. I've heard him mention it before." He couldn't help but sigh. "You guys just came to the Atrium a few days late and missed all the guild conflicts and personal grudges between Guild Masters. That guy used to be at odds with Wind. Actually, strictly speaking, during that time, except for me, basically none of the other nine Guild Masters could look at each other favorably. They often quarreled over trifles, big and small... Don't mind my harsh words, none of those nine is a simple character, and none is a good person."

Hearing this, a look of embarrassment appeared on Xiao Yong's face: "You're... truly transparent."

"Ultra is the same, paranoid to a certain extent." Master Adam subconsciously supported his forehead, and his expression truly didn't look beautiful: "At the very beginning, he was the first to start having discord with Wind. I remember, in the most serious instance, the two of them directly fought as humans. I didn't expect that a big man like him would actually take a woman seriously. No matter how much I pulled, they wouldn't separate. More importantly, those punches landing on the other's face were truly something; he didn't hold back a speck of strength. The most excessive part is that this kind of conflict erupted not once or twice. One time, it even made its way to my place..."

"Then you..."

"I cleaned them both up and threw them out. If they dared to come to my place again, I'd clean them up every time I saw them."

Xiao Yong raised an eyebrow and casually muttered: "No wonder the Guild Master sent me to act for him—turned out he was afraid of getting beaten."

With the boss's words, we could basically lock onto another suspect of this incident, Jack. About him, we only knew he was "mysterious," and didn't know anything else; not only us, but the regulars in the bar were the same.

"Take my advice," Master Adam rarely showed a serious manner. "Don't go looking for him, and don't mention him in public for no reason. His eyes and ears are all over the Atrium. Once you offend him, you're destined not to be able to handle it, unless you're seeking death."

As the sister of the Master, Jade raised a question on our behalf: "He... is very powerful?"

"More than powerful; more importantly, he's dangerous, no matter in which world." After saying this meaningfully, Master Adam snapped his fingers, signaling the bartender to bring another glass of wine for our table.

"Brother, why didn't I hear you mention him before?"

"At time, you were all very weak and hadn't grown up. Naturally, you wouldn't provoke dangerous people or come into contact with dangerous things, especially things concerning human lives."

Speaking of this, Master Adam coughed twice and took the initiative to change the subject: "Voltobautamon Jack—with your current strength, you're not yet enough to be his opponent. You should know, Plutomon being instantly killed by him didn't depend all on luck; it depended more on his own terrifying strength."

Master Adam suggested that if we still wanted to know the truth behind the matter, we could try to find X, the top talent of **Nether Club**. He was like another version of himself in **Nether Club**, knowing everything.

Agnes had concerns about this: "I've heard people say that guy doesn't have a particularly good temper, and more importantly, his face looks rather scary. Going to find him and probe him might not be that easy."

"Don't be afraid." Master Adam offered another trick for us. "His weakness, in the eyes of us Guild Masters, is practically common knowledge. Recalling back then, Master Muba used to discipline every junior who spoke rudely to him upon first meeting—he always stopped when he had the upper hand. Only X was an exception; he was beaten so miserably that a deep psychological shadow was left on him, which he hasn't been able to forget for many years. So, if during your contact with him, you feel his attitude toward you isn't particularly friendly, you can try using the name 'Ba-ye' (Ba-ye/Master Muba) to intimidate him."

"But, Brother, didn't Master Muba pass away long ago?"

"Yeah, but that guy still feels 'Ba-ye' is living in his heart, ready to lash him at any moment."

After everyone's discussion, we finally reached a consensus: the subsequent part of this matter would continue to be deeply investigated by Captain Agnes, who volunteered, and the **Five Nordic Countries Raiders****UN Five Permanent Members Raiders**. According to her, among the five of them, she's the only one free now.

"What about the other four?"

"Dragon and Zero have gone who-knows-where, Lana has to accompany their Poseidon, and Ment is busy rushing a report, leaving only your poor sister to do the work of five alone, being bossed around by the head."

Owl chimed in appropriately: "If you feel like you can't handle it alone, you can slightly depend on us."

"You?" Jade showed a bit of disdain toward Owl. "Stop joking. In 'Free Birds', the only ones truly 'free' now are you two. I don't want to be the third wheel. If you have the time, help my brother clear up those people who owe debts every day, and take more care of him for me."

"We're not nannies."

"Just treat it as my request." Jade said, glanced at her brother sitting beside her, and bumped him gently: "The bar will be closed for a week starting next week. Someone's going to have surgery. The doctor and bed have already been arranged for him. Go there and directly state my name. In a while, after I finish the affairs at the **Raiders** side, I'll bring a flower basket to visit him."

The sibling affection between them was truly enviable.

After parting, Owl went to visit the remaining three injured members of "Free Birds." I stayed at the bar, helping the boss clear the empty glasses on the table and handling the aftermath.

"By the way, Master, I had to use the 'Promotion Seed' you gave me earlier. I know this thing is very valuable and rare, so just treat it as if I owe you. In the future, if there's an opportunity, I'll definitely..."

"No need to pay it back."

"Eh?" I'm sure I didn't hear it wrong.

"That one, strictly speaking, isn't mine." Master Adam said: "Back then, just after the 'Promotion Seed' was designed, Master Muba unexpectedly obtained one. He believed the strong don't need this stuff, so he left it with me, saying that in the future, if I also became a strong person like him and didn't need this thing anymore, I should give it away, to someone who truly needs it."

It was treated like some kind of token, passed down to me through the hands of the two masters.

"Master, about the 'Master Muba' you talk about—I've asked Owl many times before, and he never told me. Can you tell me the story about him?"

"Certainly. I see you've almost finished clearing up. Shall we drink and chat?"
"Sure."
"Please."
