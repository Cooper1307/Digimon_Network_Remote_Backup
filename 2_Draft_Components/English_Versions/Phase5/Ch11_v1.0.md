# Chapter 11: Claws and Fangs (第十一章 利爪与尖牙)

This is a long story.

One day, "Free Birds" (自由鸟) received a request. The content was simple: lead our client to "Hephaestus Workshop" (赫菲斯托斯工房) to find the Head Blacksmith there, Master Nagasumi (长孙老师), and have his damaged metal data repaired. Being able to lead the way for a newcomer was our honor as seniors. However, once we arrived, we found Master Nagasumi wasn't in the house. We inquired with the neighbors for a long time, but no one knew where he had gone, which put us in a difficult position.

In Owl's words, he had known Master Nagasumi for so long and had never seen him leave his territory—especially in such a manner as to not say a word or leave a note, which was contrary to his rigorous style.

"Could he have something urgent?"

My baseless speculation was unanimously rejected by everyone.

According to their description, Master Nagasumi was a 95-year-old ethnic Chinese man who had difficulty moving and rarely, if ever, went on long journeys alone—unless he switched to his Digimon form. By doing so, he would cast off his usual frailty and return to the youngest state of his life. With the body of a Vulcanusmon (武尔坎努斯兽), he would be as fleet-footed as the wind, and the eight arms on his body were highly recognizable; one look would leave a very deep impression.

Afterward, we asked around again, but found no one who had seen him. Having no choice, we could only advise the client to return to his guild and wait. We told him we'd lead him back once Master Nagasumi returned or we found him.

Three days later, having searched every street in the Atrium, we still had nothing.

Returning to [A Cup of Bar] (喝一杯酒吧) with demoralized faces, we were greeted with the usual teasing from the regulars. Just as we were about to enjoy the drinks a few of them had offered us, a flustered man suddenly burst through the door, collapsed onto the table nearest the entrance, and panted heavily. He looked somewhat familiar; I approached and realized it was our client. He delivered a piece of very bad news—bad enough to silence the originally noisy bar.

"This is bad, this is bad... our guild is... we're fighting with the [Windrunner Brigade] (追风旅团)..."

So? I practically had this written on my face.

Seeing this, Owl proactively came over, pulled me aside, and thoughtfully added part of the setting for me: "The Atrium today is different from before. Guild wars are strictly prohibited. Once someone violates the 'Peace' principle set at the beginning—whether triggered by personal reasons or a guild—both parties in the conflict will face severe punishment from the mediation organization."

The mediation organization he mentioned was the Olympos XII (奥林匹斯十二神族). At that time, the Atrium was still in the public beta phase. The [Raiders] (攻略组) had not yet been established, the "Promotion Seeds" (晋升之种) had not been designed, the ten major guilds were hostile to each other, and Megas were pitifully few. The development team specifically selected twelve Ultimate-level test accounts with the most "responsible" attribute and granted them the power of Godly Evolution, allowing the Ultimates to evolve into temporary Megas. They formed a mediation organization composed of twelve Megas, hoping they would quell the struggles between guilds.

"Only when all twelve of them are present simultaneously can they obtain the power of Godly Evolution. If any of them dies in battle, logs out, or is pushed back to de-evolution, the remaining eleven will immediately revert to their previous Ultimate states."

In short, relying on them back then was completely unreliable.

During the mediation process, it was common to see both parties in the dispute unite and focus on attacking one person in the mediation organization. As long as that person was pushed to de-evolution, the remaining eleven would also revert. After dealing with the mediation organization, most parties in the dispute would shake hands and make up, then either leave or just continue for a bit of small fighting that wouldn't endanger lives, stopping when points were made.

"Sparrow was also one of them, evolving from Angewomon to Venusmon (维纳斯兽), implementing the love and peace she believed in to the end. Such innocence, such purity and beauty... we met under those circumstances."

The mediation organization's actions were not only thankless but also carried a high risk of losing one's life.

The development team also realized this. After the Atrium system went into official operation, they strengthened the Godly Evolution power, changing "temporary evolution into Mega" to "permanent evolution into Mega," and disconnected the twelve members, allowing them to remain as independent individuals to mediate when conflicts arose between guilds.

After that, Poseidon proactively left the mediation organization and took over the [Atlantis] (亚特兰蒂斯) guild, becoming its master. The mediation organization thus became eleven members. At that time, Sparrow was balancing between the mediation organization and "Free Birds." During an escort mission with "Free Birds," she met with misfortune and was beaten back to her Ultimate state by Diablomon (迪亚波罗兽)—thus losing her Godly Evolution power. Before the development team could design a new Godly Evolution program for her, she was taken from the world first by illness.

"Currently, there are only ten left in the mediation organization."

None of those ten were easy targets; each had power on par with a Guild Master. No single guild had the capacity to rival them. Their existence was a disaster in itself.

"Owl, what did you mean by 'severe punishment' just now?"

He directly changed his tone and answered me: "It means being slaughtered."

"Eh?"

I was deeply shocked by his answer.

According to him, under normal circumstances, as long as the two sides didn't start a fight and cooperated with the mediation organization's work, their attitudes would improve under mediation, and they wouldn't face sanctions. But this time, the ones causing the dispute were [Fang of the Beast King] (兽皇之牙) and [Windrunner Brigade]. One was the Hero Guild with the strongest self-esteem in the entire Atrium, which could least tolerate others pointing fingers at them; the other was a Free Guild that most yearned for freedom and wasn't bound by various rules. Beast vs. Bird, Fang vs. Claw—the two were already inherently at odds. Add a mediation organization into the mix, and if it really blew up, the entire Atrium might be turned upside down.

"Both Guild Masters aren't people easy to talk to. If neither cooperates, then they can only become enemies with the mediation organization. To put it bluntly, that means taking everyone in the entire guild to die together. With the strength of their two guilds, everyone combined couldn't possibly be a match for those ten, unless..."

"Unless?"

His words caught mine, as well as the attention of everyone in the bar.

"...including us."

As soon as he said that, there was an uproar. Everyone doubted their ears, and many were stunned where they stood, lost on what to do—including our client and the members of "Free Birds."

The one most emotionally agitated was Master Adam, the owner here. He put down his glass, stepped over the stool, scrambled across the bar counter, and half-crawled to Owl's side, directly pushing me away. Facing Owl, Master Adam pointed at his nose furiously, repeatedly pressing him to take back what he just said: "You're fucking crazy! Of all people to go against, you want to go against 'Gods'! Ai ya! If something really goes wrong when the time comes, I—I won't be able to protect you!"

The force of his finger was quite strong—strong enough to poke Owl back three seats. It was clear he was truly anxious over the decision Owl just made. He didn't want to lose Owl, a regular here, and even more so, he didn't want to lose a friend.

"Think I wanted this?" Owl said helplessly. "There are no people in the Atrium who can restrain Ultra and Wind. To stop things from heading in a severe direction, I can only pull them onto the same battlefront."

"But just with you all—"

"No need to say more." Owl reached out to stop Master Adam's words, gently brushing his hand aside, and convinced him completely with just one sentence: "Senior Muca expected to see no struggles between guilds, not to see two guilds bring about their own destruction due to a struggle."

These were beautiful words, and no one in the bar could refute them.

Next, Owl asked for details from our client about what triggered the conflict. Before leaving, he whispered to Master Adam for a while. I tilted my ear to eavesdrop but couldn't hear very clearly, only catching a few keywords: Jade (玉), Raiders (攻略组), investigation. I estimated that Owl had discovered some issue and wanted Master Adam to pass this matter through his sister, Jade, to the head of the [Raiders], so he could issue a timely command for the [Raiders] to take over the investigation as soon as possible. After all, our power here was limited and wouldn't last long.

Carrying the gift Master Adam gave me, the entire "Free Birds" team, under the gaze of a bunch of drunks, followed our client to the next battlefield—Sanhara (山栖原). That was the public domain where the two major guilds were located; neither had set up a building-type guild base. Compared to the flashy buildings of other guilds, they cared more about the people in the guild and the feeling they brought.

Did the four of us have any intention of going to die with Owl? Honestly, no. It was mainly that Owl put on an air of urgency, as if if we didn't go, it would all be over. So, we were all forced; he didn't seek our consent.

I spent the whole way trying to convince myself, and finally followed them to this desolate plateau.

Sanhara is located within the Atrium, in the southwestern periphery. Standing at the edge of the cliff here, one can overlook the entire Atrium. The scenery is exceptionally beautiful, with a gentle breeze blowing against the face, feeling very close to nature. It would be even better without those three groups of people behind us.

Briefly: on our left were all the guild members of [Windrunner Brigade] who were currently online, led by their Guild Master, Wind. Most could fly, with only a small portion staying on the ground, facing the breeze with enjoyable expressions on their faces. On our right was the Beast Army led by the Guild Master of [Fang of the Beast King], Ultra. They rarely kept their human forms; as they said, "Heroes never reveal their true identity to outsiders," which was actually just a bunch of hopeless, hot-blooded bastards.

The two major guilds faced off against each other, and the ten Mediators stood opposite us, watching the situation. Each of them looked like they weren't to be trifled with; one of them I even knew—the eight arms were more than obvious.

By then, Owl had already switched to his Digimon form, ready to act at any time. I went to his side, looked at the "Dramon Killer" on his arms, and asked: "Are you sure you want to be enemies with Master Nagasumi? Do you still want him to help repair your equipment in the future?"

Owl was indifferent: "The old man is very magnanimous; as long as I don't face him directly, it'll be fine."

"Magnanimous?" I learned a new vocabulary word today.

Before we, the "Free Birds", arrived, the three parties were in discussion. Led by the mediation organization, the content was nothing more than asking if both sides had a fight; if so, they'd slaughter them both. In this situation, even if the two sides really did fight before, they couldn't admit it now. However, even if both sides chose to deny it, the mediation organization would still determine they had fought, because the evidence was right before them—large craters on the ground and burnt grass told the whole story.

After questioning the Guild Masters of both sides in groups, we temporarily understood the current situation: while on a training run, [Fang of the Beast King] encountered [Windrunner Brigade]. They originally wanted to stop and greet each other, but unexpectedly, a patch of Chaos suddenly descended from the sky, and the massive impact instantly swept through both guilds. Both sides paid a painful price for it. Before they could recover from the impact, the mediation organization arrived.

"A bit too obvious," Dove couldn't help but remark.

I also couldn't help but add my agreement: "Yeah, too obvious... If both Guild Masters weren't lying, then this must have been the work of a third party, purposely triggering a dispute, purposely drawing the mediation organization here, purposely framing them. The only thing unclear is the purpose and behavior of such an act."

"And the identity of the culprit."

Crane timely added for me. The level of tacit understanding between us had further deepened.

Simultaneously, Owl had taken Falcon forward to negotiate with the representative of the mediation organization, Jupitermon (朱庇特兽). He wanted to do his best to secure zero sanctions for both sides, but unexpectedly, the other party wouldn't take his bait. Instead, they stated that as outsiders, if we didn't leave and insisted on interceding for both sides, we would be treated as meddling bystanders obstructing their official duties.

"Don't be silly," Owl advised Jupitermon. "I don't even know these two Guild Masters; why would I have the time for this? I advise you all to behave. Senior Muca wouldn't want to see you destroy any guild."

"Senior Muca is our benefactor. You shouldn't mention him."

Owl asked back: "Then why did you?"

"Mentioning him is to kill you."

Owl was deeply surprised: "When did you become so tyrannical?"

"Since you mentioned him..."

Two sentences, and negotiations broke down. The other party's killing intent was set; Owl was destined for trouble this time.

To minimize the damage, Owl had to suggest: until things were cleared up, let the members of both guilds go for now. They were innocent and shouldn't be involved when they couldn't resist.

"Sanctions must be executed in person."

"I know. What I mean is, if you insist on imposing sanctions, I suggest you try pointing your slaughtering blades at the Guild Masters and their elites, as well as the 'Free Birds' who will stand before you to protect them until things become clear. If you have the guts, bring it on."

"Think we don't?"

"That's right, afraid you all don't have the guts to play a fair one-on-one game with us 'rookies'."

"You have five minutes to prepare your last words."

Jupitermon, on behalf of the mediation organization, accepted Owl's provocation. After returning, Owl explained the situation to us and also told the Guild Masters of the two major guilds. They gladly accepted Owl's proposal, stating they were willing to call a truce and find a way to survive the sanctions first, otherwise the entire guild would be finished.

Out of curiosity, I asked: "So, was there really a conflict between you?"

They didn't admit it, but neither did they deny it. Living on the same Sanhara, being neighbors, a few small collisions and frictions were perfectly normal and wouldn't be very severe. The two Guild Masters usually turned a blind eye to it, and no one took it to heart, as if it didn't exist. The key issue now was: who had magnified this usually small conflict to the point that it attracted the mediation organization's attention and intervention?

"Time will give us the answer," Owl said. "I've already asked someone to investigate in advance. It still needs some time. As long as we hold on and aren't defeated by them, the victory will be ours."

"So that's why you left behind the Guild Masters and elites..."

"Exactly." Owl proactively apologized to me: "Sorry, Sakura, for dragging you in again. If you're unwilling..."

"I'm willing." I proactively declined his long-belated and useless apology. "Risking my life to accompany a gentleman isn't the first time I've done it. Besides, ten against ten—the numbers must match. We aren't their match to begin with, so if we don't show some spirit, people will laugh."

During our sentimental moment, the two Guild Masters respectively called their elites from the guild crowds. Guild Master Ultra, in his form as BanchoLeomon (番长狮子兽), called out a person he named "Xiao Yong" from his Beast Army, whose image was a Rasenmon (螺旋兽), standing beside the Master like a lieutenant. Guild Master Wind also transformed into Orphanimon's (奥尼斯兽) image and successfully took to the sky, calling out "Rainbow Starlight"—AncientIrismon (古代彩虹兽) Plume (羽) and Hououmon (凤凰兽) Wing (翼) from the bird flock behind him. Judging by their appearance, the intimidation they brought far surpassed their Guild Master.

"My side is settled. Talons are on standby."

"Same here. Fangs never falter."

At this point, Guild Master Ultra finally delivered a complete greeting to his old rival. Then, he put on a senior-like air, turned toward "Xiao Yong" the Rasenmon standing beside him, and told him: "The rookies behind us will retreat when we start acting. What we need to do is entangle the enemy before us and leave them no chance to give chase. Protecting the weak is the responsibility of the strong. Do you hear me, Xiao Yong!"

"Yes!"

The immediate response was seen by the three who had already taken to the sky, and they couldn't help but let out a sigh: It's good to be young.

The ten Punishers were ready, each having picked their prey, just waiting for the final sixty seconds to pass.

Jupitermon VS BlackWarGreymon
Junomon VS Mastemon
Ceresmon VS Orphanimon
Bacchusmon VS MegaGargomon
Apollomon & Dianamon VS AncientIrismon & Hououmon
Merukimon VS CresGarurumon
Minervamon VS Rosemon
Marsmon VS BanchoLeomon
Vulcanusmon VS Rasenmon

"Everyone, are you ready?"

The nine of us were unusually unified.

With Owl's command, a century-level ten-on-to showdown was about to begin. The first to enter the scene was the mutual greeting between claws and fangs.
