# Chapter 14: Dragon and God (第十四章 龙与神)

"How long will it take? Give me a straight answer!" The rookie's temper was quite explosive.

"Uh, anyway, I didn't bring paper. I don't know how long it'll take to air-dry. Figure it out yourself."

I hope he conveys the message completely.

Speeding along the road, while waiting for a red light, I grabbed my phone. The Atrium system news page automatically pushed a message to me with an exceptionally eye-catching title: [Windrunner Brigade] VS [Fang of the Beast King]. Clicking in for details, it actually included live broadcast footage. Watching for a few seconds, I found it quite interesting. Just as I was about to put down the phone and start moving, "Freya," the golden bird that followed Agnes at all times, sent a request for help in data form, telling us to come quickly—its master was about to give in.

"Sorry, I'm still on the road. If I don't move soon, the driver behind me is going to rush up and hit me."

After replying to such a message, I put down the phone, stepped on the gas, and hurried through the intersection just as the signal light turned yellow—the road ahead was clear.

Entering Zealand and passing through Slagelse, my mother called me, asking if I could visit her tonight and have dinner with her. I said I was busy; even though I was currently less than two kilometers from the nursing home where she lived, I still couldn't slow down because in another world, there was someone waiting for me to save them.

"...be proud of him, your son is on his way to be a hero." While saying this, I subconsciously pulled out an identity verification card from my pocket. I never expected it to be here—no wonder I couldn't find it no matter how much I searched the whole house a few days ago.

"Wait, Mom!" I suddenly remembered something. "Does your nursing home have EDEN somatosensory equipment?"

"Of course, otherwise, how did you think your wheelchair-bound mother experiences life every day?"

I felt relieved with her words; just don't find another father for me.

Making a temporary detour, I burst into the nursing home, inserted the identity verification card, and logged into the Atrium system. I hope my appearance isn't too late.

**Participant ID:** NO.05000
**Holder:** Erich Freyr Hansen
**Sex:** Male
**Age:** 43
**Participant Identity:** Freyr
**Digimon:** Imperialdramon: Dragon Mode (帝皇龙甲兽：龙形态)
**Guild:** [Dragon's Den] (御龙巢穴)

**Confirm Login**
YES / NO

"Go, son, knock them all down!"
"Actually, I'm going to save someone... well, no problem. Love you, Mom."

Touching the left button, I logged in successfully, then immediately switched to the Digimon form and hurried toward the coordinates given by "Freya." Along the way, I passed three guild territories and finally reached the territory of [Nether Club] (幽冥俱乐部), just in time to see my old acquaintance Heath in charge of evacuation work here.

I approached and asked what was going on, and he told me it was all the work of the other four.

I felt something was wrong. Before he could finish his sentence, I took the lead in cutting him off, and then flapped the massive wings on both sides and hurried forward. Before long, I saw a black fellow with a blood-red cloak from afar, about to attack a Vikemon (维京兽). Behind him lay our team's [Defense Position] and [Support Position], both dying and seemingly having just gone through a fierce battle. From this, I inferred that the Vikemon must be our newcomer; when I last saw him, he was a Zudomon.

"—Positron Laser!"

Not until I presented him with a meeting gift did I see clearly that our enemy was Plutomon (普路托兽). His image was a bit different from my impression; specifically, it might be that patch of black Chaos extra on his back, which looked a bit out of place with his overall presence, a bit discordant.

Facing my sudden attack, Plutomon unhurriedly pulled his cloak to defend against it. The energy muzzles on his back continued to output; no matter how powerful his cloak was, it couldn't hold up. Soon, after I lunged forward and used the sharp blades on my forefeet to slash him with "Splendor Blade," he disappeared into the ruins below.

Next, it was time to face my teammates.

"Sorry, I'm late." I originally wanted to say this to them.
"If you hadn't come, we'd be dead!" I originally thought they would answer this way.

As it turned out, none of us followed the common script.

"How come the [Main Attack Position] isn't here, you all are making a fuss like bears, playing dead together?"
"Freyr!"

They called out my name with great affection. At that moment, I felt like a hero, admired and envied by them. Then, they asked that stupid question in unison: "You... air-dried?"

I didn't really want to answer them; telling the truth would truly ruin the atmosphere.

I suddenly remembered a sentence said by Master Adam, my former savior: Do not let your guard down until you confirm the enemy is completely finished. Clearly, I made this mistake and was one step late; the enemy's cruel claws were already approaching me, so close that I couldn't make any reaction. Fortunately, the newcomer in front of me timely threw the two heavy war hammers on his back, which saved my life.

"Thanks, newcomer..."
"Watch out—"

He stood in front of me again, using the thick shield on his shoulder to take Plutomon's Chaos strike. At this point, I could no longer stand being saved by a newcomer; such an embarrassing thing was enough twice, I didn't need a third time.

"Get out of the way, newcomer!"

I pushed him aside, intending to let that hateful enemy taste "Mega Death." Unexpectedly, the opponent beat me to it. After taking a hit from "Chaos Light" head-on, my whole body went limp on the ground, unable to move anymore. The surrounding environment was gradually being swallowed by the black Chaos behind him; now I was the one who should be saved.

Tell me, whose [Main Attack Position] is so miserable right after appearing? Only the five Nordic countries.

"Any last words, big idiot?"

He completely enraged me—he's finished!

"Yeah, of course." I told him. "It's hidden in my mouth."

By now, I'm not hiding any trump cards; use them when they should be used, never being stingy. Whether I can break through this patch of black Chaos depends entirely on what I previously held in my mouth. Before I switched to the Digimon form, I took a treasure from my personal inventory and swallowed it—it was a rare item called "Promotion Seed" (晋升之种). Its role, to put it broadly, could turn around the current critical situation, and more specifically, could help me save everyone's lives.

"Come on!"

I roared and swallowed it, after which my body underwent a very obvious change.

**Imperialdramon: Dragon Mode** (帝皇龙甲兽：龙形态) — **Mode Change** — **Imperialdramon: Fighter Mode** (帝皇龙甲兽：战士形态).

With the mode change, the body became more than just a little bit more flexible. Facing the enemy in this state, even with a ten-minute time limit, the enemy would surely feel heavily pressured and shocked.

It was just as I thought. Once I completed the mode change and confronted the enemy again, I could clearly feel a weakening trend in his momentum. I'd taken all the spotlight; I wonder how he feels now, presumably already prepared to pay the price. In that case, I don't need to be polite with him either—the old way, blast him to death.

With shots of "Super Positron Laser" (超级光子镭射), he was gradually unable to hold up and could only use the patch of black Chaos on his back as a shield in front of him. Taking this opportunity, the remaining three suddenly rose up—no, to be precise, four, as the Finnish guy from the [Vanguard Position] had just arrived. The four of them, with injuries all over, let the Plutomon before them experience a gift from Northern Europe; I guess, besides a blizzard, there wasn't much else to give him.

 The target was not Plutomon, but the patch of black Chaos defending him. It was like a ball of floating fire, always protecting its master. Unfortunately, in the triple blizzard storm, it couldn't hold on for long and was soon frozen solid, subjected to Olegmon's "Viking Swipes," and dissipated into data dust among the clouds.

Losing the protection of the black Chaos, Plutomon was in total disarray and tried to escape, but he was surrounded by the five of us. What happened next is for you to imagine. "Bifröst," "Arrow of Aurvandil," "Dual Tomahawk Spin," "Mjolnir Hammer"—every skill that could be used was used on him. Finally, under the impact of a "Giga Death" released after I gathered energy, Plutomon's mission came to a complete end.

The streets were torn up, and the town was ruined. Looking at the large crater left on the ground, everyone let out a sigh—except for our captain, Miss Agnes, who alone was searching for Plutomon's remains, for unknown reasons.

I subconsciously advised her: "Stop looking. The impact range was so large, there probably isn't a speck left..."

She temporarily believed me. After confirming the clean-up work on site had begun, she took us back to report.

The five of us dragged our tired bodies and sat in [A Cup of Bar] for a long time before the client Jade showed up. Her face didn't look particularly beautiful; perhaps she had encountered unpleasant things on the road.

"You've finally arrived, our competitors."

She rarely missed greeting me, and without a word, she sat at our table. After much hesitation, she told us a piece of news she had just heard from someone else.

To summarize: after taking my "Giga Death," Plutomon luckily survived. He breathed his last and ran to the base of [Nether Club], begging Master Jack to save him and repair his missing data. It's unclear what they communicated—perhaps Master Jack was dissatisfied with his actions, or perhaps he was afraid his arrival would involve him—so he switched to the form of Voltobautamon (幽灵面具兽) and smoothly finished him off with "Palazzo Waltz."

"...it can be considered that evil has its own retribution."

Is that truly the case? Perhaps we will never know.

Both were users who settled into the Atrium during the internal beta period, both were pioneers who were active on the front line during the public beta period. One was recruited by the later [Raiders] (攻略组), one was selected by the former development team. One created "Free Birds," one formed the mediation organization.

One was named Owl, one was named Vulture (鹫).

They were the same—both were strong, both became heroes, and both harvested their respective feelings afterward.

They were also different. one left the guild because of a bet and gradually faded from the Atrium world, with no newcomers knowing who he was; one became the object of public criticism among guilds back then—anyone in the Mega stage didn't take him seriously.

Now they meet again, both following their own path, each calling the other their enemy, neither mentioning the time they fought side by side back then, as if they didn't know each other from the beginning. Everyone knew it was meaningless to continue fighting—it was thankless and would lead to injuries—yet no one was willing to back off. The reason was obvious: the opponent's existence was enough to constitute their reason to continue fighting.

Between the exchanges, the hearts of both were shouting to the other: stop fighting, or die.

The hearts of both were struggling. No one wanted to hurt the other, nor did they want to be hurt by the other, and even less did they want to see their own people hurt by the other's. They were powerless over themselves: explosions echoed in the sky, and thunderbolts descended sternly. One by one, they unleashed their signature moves on each other, watched each other being hit as they drifted further away, disappearing into the hazy smoke. No one slackened, for they knew each other and knew it wouldn't be long before the other would take revenge in the same way—this was the pact they made together back then.

"In the future, if you and I become enemies, please don't take it easy on me. Treat me as you should, as if we don't know each other, so as not to affect each other's judgment."
"You too. I don't want to be a sentimental fellow. I also want to lose somewhat decently. So, in case there really is such a day, do not be polite with me where you should take my life. Being defeated by the 'Jet-Black Hero' is my honor."

Facing "Thundercloud Thunderbolt" (雷云霹雳) with "War Blaster" (战争爆破), the Dragon Warrior felt no confusion.
Facing "Dramon Killer" (龙兽克星) with a pair of "Judgment Hammers" in his hands, the God of the Sky made no compromise.

Dragon and God, holding respect for each other, harboring hostility, understanding each other's feelings, and at the same time empathizing with the tactics used, pondering each other's thoughts, continuously testing, and reacting timely to eliminate future troubles.

Heavy hammers struck the "Dramon Killer," splashing dancing sparks and leaving brands for the judgment current descending from the sky to track. The Dragon Warrior raised both arms' "Dramon Killer," merged them together, rotated his body at high speed, dispersed the "Punishing Judgment" from the God of the Sky, and at the same time caused the air around him to start rotating, gradually gathering to form a "Black War Tornado" with a wide range, returning it as a gift of many years to his old friend.

In a flash of gazes, it was as if returning to those years.

"You have no sword, not even a decent weapon, yet you come to learn swordsmanship from Master Muca. What for? Can you talk to me, Owl?"
"To be able to use it one day."
"Nonsense."
"And you?" the Dragon Warrior asked back.
"The same as you," the God of the Sky snorted and replied: "I need power and technology far beyond yours to prevent myself from losing to a strong person like you in the future. If you think I'm being modest or flattering, then I might have to disappoint you."

Dragon took God as a competitor; he saw the "responsibility" the other bore on his shoulders. God took Dragon as his goal; he saw the "courage" stored in the other's heart. They were both the truly strong in each other's eyes, both respected each other, and at the same time, both looked down on each other, just because the other wasn't on the same path.

Between "Truth" and "Principle," the Dragon Warrior chose the former, while the God of the Sky chose the latter.

Both raised their swords simultaneously. One severed the shackles called "Principle" in exchange for the freedom to pursue "Truth"; the other split open the confusion brought by "Truth" and held onto the "Principle" he revered in his heart.

No one was right, and no one was wrong.

"What about you, Master Muca?"

Both wanted to know. However, times had changed, and the person who could answer this question had forever bid farewell to them. They would never get a satisfactory answer—or rather, they had already gotten that satisfactory answer.

Pursue "Truth" without losing "Principle."

Actually, their teacher had long set an example and answered them with practical actions. Until today—to be precise, after they were hit by the ultimate moves released by the other—they only then had some awareness: when the concentrated "Dark Gaia Force" hit "Wide-Range Divine Punishment" head-on, the two violent impacts collided, repelled each other, and finally merged completely to be released outward—the generated energy was enough to shake the entire Atrium.

Excellent warriors always leave a trick for themselves, and both of them were no exception. One detached the shield on his back, one pulled the feather cloak behind him, to resist the impact they suffered.

In the process, the God of the Sky, Vulture, suddenly sensed the fall of his wife, Junomon. He was extremely furious, voiced a roar at the sky, and then turned grief and indignation into strength, swallowed the "Promotion Seed" inherited from his wife, cast aside the feather cloak blocking him, and began to face that destructive damage head-on.

"Lagi, I will live well for your share... For that, I must not fall here!"

At that moment, he broke through the limit, continuously gathered the energy brought by the impact around him, and finally, it constituted his torso. The golden color deepened, and the "Judgment Hammer" turned into a giant lightning sword, thus completing a qualitative leap.

**Jupitermon** (朱庇特兽) — **Mode Change** — **Jupitermon: Wrath Mode** (朱庇特兽：雷霆形态).

"Is it time?"

Owl looked at Vulture before him, inexplicably showing a few traces of sentimentality.

He was so unwilling to face such a painful him, but if he didn't, his own people would have to, and among his own people, no one was his match. Therefore, Owl must make a choice before Vulture could act.

Taking out the "Promotion Seed," Owl hesitated for a long time.

He once reached the end of the "Guild War," only one step away from winning, but unfortunately lost to the person he made a bet with and lost the qualification to obtain the "Promotion Seed." After that, by chance, the two met again. Thinking the world was small, less meeting would be better, but as it turned out, the Dragon gave the "Promotion Seed" he had obtained to Owl, which made Owl very confused and unable to understand.

"Such humiliation, I'm afraid I cannot accept it."
"What are you thinking!" the Dragon was indifferent.
"I don't know the winner's intention."

Without much nonsense with Owl, the Dragon stated bluntly: "A guy like me with an undefeated body doesn't need this stuff. On the contrary, look at the people following you all day, and you're so eager to get it—I'll help you a small favor. Just use it to protect the people around you. Don't wait until you lose them for regret to set in..."

He was right; he truly needed such an opportunity, right here and now.

"Falcon, Dove, Crane, Sakura—for you, I... must win this battle!"

Swallowing the "Promotion Seed," Owl decided to go all out in the battle.

A huge globe of light instantly engulfed Owl, peeling off a portion of the violent impact and merging it into his body, making the "Dramon Killer" on both his arms gradually transform into a massive sword named "Victory Charge" (胜利破碎者). The "Brave Shield" on his back began to converge inward, becoming more suitable for offense. Last of all, the body changed from the original black to orange.

**BlackWarGreymon** (黑战斗暴龙兽) — **Species Change** — **VictoryGreymon** (胜利暴龙兽).

Breaking through the limit, sword against sword—this was the best way to commemorate his master.

"Thanks, Dragon."

The combat time limit was only a short ten minutes. Exceeding the limit meant defeat. If they wanted to decide the outcome within the limit, both had to apply 120% of their focus to respond; neither could hold back.

Through the organization's internal voice system, Vulture notified the remaining of his people, telling them to stop as soon as possible, and also telling them to tell their respective opponents to give up the meaningless struggle. The win or loss now depended on the final showdown between the two captains; all hope was pinned on them.

"This day, I've waited for a long time..."
"Who hasn't!"

The heroic Dragon Warrior took the massive sword from his shoulder and pointed it at his old friend, taking the lead in stating his position: "[Data Clearing Stream], Owl—entering the stage!"
The God of the Sky followed closely: "[Data Clearing Stream], Vulture—entering the stage!"

Afterward, both simultaneously showed a confident tone toward each other, gripped the massive swords in their hands at the same time, and quickly approached each other after the impact before them completely dissipated. Two massive swords crossed, parried each other, producing massive energy that pushed the two apart, forcing them to pull distance again.

The head-on clash yielded no results, so both immediately changed strategy, launching a series of sword hacks supported by speed. Dragging the massive swords in their hands, the two shuttled between the forest and the wilderness. Every sword swung was exceptionally heavy, and the damage caused was enough to change a part of the terrain. Both being members of the [Data Clearing Stream] taught by Muca, both worked equally hard and both received the master's personal instruction. Therefore, in terms of swordsmanship, the two were on par, making it hard to decide a winner.

Owl swung his sword, and Vulture retreated and jumped onto a nearby tree, then raised the lightning sword in his hand and fired a golden flash of lightning to the sky. A large patch of thunderclouds responded to his call, raining down fierce thunderbolts in response.
