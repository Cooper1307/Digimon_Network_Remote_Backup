# Chapter 12: Battle of Sanhara (第十二章 鏖战)

Falcon was still in the lead, rotating his body first to use "Wolf Revolution" (兽狼大回旋), successfully neutralizing Merukimon's (墨丘利兽) "Thousand Fist Hit" (千重拳打). Before the opponent could use his beloved saber "Aztec" to expand space and summon/control otherworldly monsters, Falcon used his "Yellow Beast Scimitar" to parry him first. From then on, the contest between the two shifted from speed to strength.

Dove followed closely with his massive body, grabbing his opponent Bacchusmon (巴克科斯兽) and dragging him into the nearby mountains for a sequence of heavy bombardments. The reason he chose this "Brewmaster of the Digital World" as his opponent was entirely because his mechanical body didn't fear poisoning. Taking on factors for his teammates that were difficult for them to solve on their own was his operational principle as the [Defense Position].

Crane faced off against Jupitermon's wife, Junomon (朱 Juno 兽). As soon as they made contact, they soared into the sky and vanished from everyone's sight. In fact, it wasn't just Crane; Guild Master Wind and the two from "Rainbow Starlight" were the same. The only difference was that their battle would weave through the clouds, occasionally unveiling the cloud layers to reveal the sun, or diving into dark clouds, leaving behind a few beautiful traces for people to admire and capture.

The most intense was definitely the duel between beasts.

Facing his evolution form Marsmon (玛尔斯兽), Guild Master Ultra showed no trace of timidity. Even though he knew his chances of winning this battle were less than ten percent, he did not retreat, still acting like a senior with a heart full of hot blood, setting an example for his junior Xiao Yong. Fists and feet clashed as the two performed multiple sets of fighting techniques. Aside from being slightly inferior in strength, Guild Master Ultra was on par with the opponent in other aspects—neither side gained an advantage.

"As expected of the Guild Master of [Fang of the Beast King]. Compared to the debris in the Atrium, you truly are different."

"Same to you, same to you."

The body might suffer, but the mouth must not give in easily—paying back the opponent in their own coin was the duty of a "fighter" and even more so the basic protocol of a hero.

Seizing the dust storm raised before them to obscure the enemy's vision, Guild Master Ultra ignited his fighting spirit, unleashing "Burning War Soul," concentrating the raging flames from across his body into his right fist, and firing a powerful lion-shaped flame shockwave at the enemy. Marsmon was well-prepared; he took the gift head-on, gathering the flames around him to cover his entire body, then kicked off the ground, leaping up from the dust toward the scorching sun within reach, about to unleash his most magnificent killing move in the air.

"Prepare yourself!"

"My thoughts exactly!"

With his fighting spirit burning to the limit, Guild Master Ultra made no compromise in terms of momentum. Facing the enemy's finishing move, he should respond with an equally magnificent ultimate skill.

"—Corona Sanctions!"

"Taste this—Flash Bancho Punch!"

Two absolute forces converged at one point, triggering a violent impact that tore up the turf, exposed the rock surface hidden below, and twisted the originally gentle wind, turning everything combustible within sight into ashes.

"Master—"

"Take care of yourself first!"

Compared to the senior with rich combat experience, Xiao Yong, the "Star of Tomorrow," was not as composed.

Unable to worry about his Master's situation, he was being suppressed all the way by Master Nagasumi, continuously suffering alternate strikes from eight arms holding various weapons. At this moment, no matter how many drills he had mounted on his body, they were of no use. Before set out, I had asked Owl about Master Nagasumi's combat strength; according to Owl, Master Nagasumi isn't a particularly strong combat unit, but the stance he takes whenever he uses force looks very fierce, making it very easy to intimidate people and put them into a passive state of continuous beating. Now it seemed it was truly the case.

Of course, no matter how inexperienced a young person was, he wouldn't willingly become a punching bag under an old senior. Using his agile posture, he tried to dodge again and again. Although there were many failures along the way, fortunately, he kept them within an acceptable range for himself, not to the extent of being suppressed by the opponent for a long time.

"I'm sorry, Senior!"

Leaning his body forward and rolling on the ground, he successfully dodged the triple pincer attack of the sword, hammer, and staff swung by Master Nagasumi. At the same time, he rotated the blades on his arms and, at the moment of standing up, unleashed a powerful series of punches, "Gyro Smash," at the old senior who was rapidly closing in on him.

Taking the chain punches from the junior head-on, Master Nagasumi's voice clearly carried some pain. He knelt on one knee, let out a sigh, lamenting that the younger generation was to be feared, then suddenly activated all his power, attacking like a storm. The two arms at the very back, holding morning star hammers, launched the attack first. While Xiao Yong was retreating to dodge, he threw the metal clubs from the front row, hitting the target head-on. As Xiao Yong looked to the sky to voice his pain, the double swords in the front row and the double hammers in the second row began to play their roles, respectively aiming at Xiao Yong's arms and chest, vowing to hammer and dismember him.

"Don't blame me, kid. Heaven's will is hard to defy!"

Heaven's will? Could it be that they, the mediation organization, were also acting out of necessity?

They were very close—so close that before Xiao Yong could react, the double hammers and double swords were already nearing his body. It was impossible to resist now unless there was help from a benefactor. And that benefactor was Owl.

He had concentrated the "Dark Gaia Force" in his palm in advance. Using the chance to dodge Jupitermon's "Punishing Judgment," he sent it out smoothly, delivering it to his old friend. It blew apart the sword and hammer in his hand, saving the junior's life while also giving him a reminder—there had never been any so-called Heaven's will in the Atrium; even if there were, it had long been severed by the two "Kukurin" blades in Senior "Muca's" hands. As his former colleague, he must never do something Muca wouldn't want to see.

Master Nagasumi sensed his old friend's intention; everything looked so natural.

Once the smoke cleared, the tide of battle had turned. Xiao Yong caught the opportunity just now and rotated the blades on his hands at ultra-high speed, triggering the tornado "Feeling Explosion" (感受化爆风), which instantly engulfed Master Nagasumi's figure.

"You still have time to worry about others?"

"Why not? I'm just learning from you." Owl turned to face Jupitermon directly. "If it weren't for you worrying about your own people and fearing to affect them, you would have used 'Wide-Range Divine Punishment' to send this virus seed of mine on its way long ago, wouldn't you?"

"Clever."

"You flatter me."

With those words, Jupitermon extended his arms, struck the heavy hammers in his left and right hands against each other, summoned small thunderclouds, and continuously rained "Thundercloud Thunderbolts" onto the area where Owl was. While using the "Brave Shield" to resist the lightning strikes from above, Owl rapidly approached Jupitermon. After reaching a certain distance, he saw his chance, dived into the thundercloud, used the "Dark Gaia Force" he had sent out just now as cover, locked onto the shortest straight line to the opponent, and unleashed "Black War Tornado" (黑暗战斗龙卷风).

A powerful whirlwind piercing strike came head-on. Jupitermon knew he couldn't match the strength; to save his life, he was forced to abandon one arm and the heavy hammer in his hand. At the same time, he swung the other heavy hammer, slamming Owl directly onto the ground.

"Sacrificing a pawn to save the king—clever."

"You flatter me!"

This was a person who had lost an arm and a weapon making a confirmation of strength toward another person whose chest armor was damaged.

My own situation was relatively simple: my opponent was Minervamon (密涅瓦兽). Her behavior completely mismatched her name; she was simple to a certain extent, such that toward an opponent like me without fighting intent, she would only rush up and hack. The great sword "Olympia" in her hand was quite sharp, and I didn't want to be hacked by it, so I could only dodge again and again, or at worst, flick out the "Thorn Whip" to bind her. Afterward, she still refused to settle down. I had no choice but to discharge electricity again, trying to make her sleep right then and there, only to find she was immune to electric shocks. Not only that, she also struggled and used the great sword in her hand to cut through the thorn vines binding her, regaining her freedom.

Without a word, she unleashed "Strike Slash" at me. While dodging, I used "Rosy Velvet" to restrict her movement on the ground. With a loud shout in a young girl's voice, she leaped forcefully and used the horizontal spinning slash "Crazy Carousel," raising a massive tornado. Such a powerful move was beyond my ability to withstand.

Hoping Owl would help me, I looked back to see him being constantly targeted by Jupitermon and watched very closely—he had no time at all. My other companions weren't within sight either. For now, the only person I could rely on was myself.

My brain worked at high speed. Suddenly, a "Giglio" (巨人导弹) fell from the sky. I guessed Dove, the [Defense Position], was performing his duty again. I, the [Support Position], naturally had to work hard too. At this thought, I quickly lay flat on the ground. Minervamon in the tornado was not so lucky—she didn't see the "Giglio" at all. Holding the great sword, she hacked at it using the momentum of the tornado. The missile exploded on contact, and she was blown a long distance away, falling flat on her face—the scene was as comical as it was embarrassing. If the person she liked saw this, she probably wouldn't get married in this life.

Our task was to entangle the ten Mediators and stall for time so the person Owl sent to investigate the mastermind behind the scenes could get results as soon as possible. Therefore, we must never leave our targets. Even if she just fell face-first and embarrassedly squeezed out a few crystal tears in front of you, you mustn't show the slightest sympathy for her. Instead, you should mock her—preferably the kind between women. The effect is significant; she will rush at you as if she's gone mad. At this time, what you need to do is use the whip in your hand to whip her frantically until she can withstand your whipping and rush up to pin you to the ground. Then you can pull her into your arms and let her experience for herself just how peaceful sleeping in the "Rosy Cradle" can be.

Looking up at the sky, besides the thunderclouds flashing past, there were also more rainbow starlight sparks than one could count. It was clear that Guild Master Wind and the two from "Rainbow Starlight" were not finding it easy to deal with their opponents.

A loud noise came from the sky as Crane and Junomon held each other and fell into a forest in the mountains. I wanted to rush over to help her, but just as I took a step forward, a violent attraction magnetic field was generated in the forest. Clearly, this was the result of Crane using "Chaos Degradation."

I leaned against a massive rock to prevent myself from being sucked in. Before the dimensional gate closed, another explosion came from not far away. Standing slightly and looking, Dove's figure flashed before my eyes, followed by Owl and Jupitermon who had been chasing and hitting him. In addition, a sleeping Minervamon lay beside me. This was the environment I was currently in: tense, exciting, yet tedious.

Again, I hate fighting, but I have to fight. Just after winning a battle with great difficulty and finally relaxing to take a couple of deep breaths, another battle was triggered before my eyes.

The person who triggered it was Jupitermon. He discovered the sleeping Minervamon, struck his heavy hammer, and brought down a lightning strike from the sky, hitting her and making her awaken into another state. Or rather, he granted her some energy, making her evolve into a higher-stage Digimon.

Minervamon (密涅瓦兽), Evolution—Mervamon (梅尔瓦兽).

Mature, steady, powerful, and charming—this was the brand-new feeling she brought me.

Whenever I saw the great sword "Olympia Kai" held in her right hand and the "Medullia" on her left wrist, I felt more and more that I was no match for her, especially in a state where my own nerves were tensed.

"Don't be afraid..."

Owl arrived in time to comfort me, but it didn't have much effect.

Continuous lightning strikes drove him away, and Jupitermon also exited the scene, very gentlemanly leaving space for us two girls alone, wishing for Mervamon to kill me. Naturally, I wouldn't let him have his wish. These days, who hasn't hidden one or two ultimate skills? Whether I can beat her is one thing, but as for self-preservation, there is theoretically no problem. After all, Master Adam gave me good instructions: do not use the little gift he gave me unless it's absolutely necessary. In his words, the role of the little gift is to save my life, not to fight for it.

This was a real, solid, arduous battle.

She was a virus type, and I was a data type; I gained no advantage in attributes. Therefore, whether to use this final trump card would entirely depend on whether she could walk out of my "Forbidden Temptation" alive.

I said harsh words to her: "Are you ready to accept my temptation?"

She raised the great sword in her hand and replied with a determined gaze: "If you have the guts, bring it on!"

These were the most heroic words I had ever heard from a woman's mouth. I had to admit, she successfully ignited my fighting spirit, making it necessary for me to show my true trump card and fight her to the death.
