# Chapter 15: Beautiful Ending (第十五章 美丽的终结)

In the face of the lightning bolts, Owl's dodging could be described as slow as an old turtle in its twilight years. He didn't want to lose his head, so he could only stand there, swinging the massive sword in his hand, rejecting the invitation from heaven again and again.

Seeing this, Vulture rose again, suspended in the sky, arriving at Owl's blind spot. He injected a portion of his energy into the massive sword, then aimed at Owl's body and thrust down, executing a new form of "Punishing Judgment." Owl had actually noticed his old friend's ill intentions long ago; he kept a close eye on the other's movements. When the lightning sword thrust down from behind his head, Owl immediately gripped the "Victory Charge" tightly, turned, and unleashed "Victory Strike" (胜利冲击) at Vulture. Using the massive blade of the "Victory Charge" as protection, he absorbed the energy stored in the opponent's blade and released it again—it looked as if Vulture's attack had been completely reflected.

Vulture was caught off guard by Owl's move and suffered the pain he had brought upon himself. Before he could adjust his body for stable suspension, Owl's next move of revenge had already arrived.

The ten-minute limit was approaching, and time was running out.

Owl had no time to think and directly unleashed his ultimate move, "Trident Gaia." Rotating the hilt, he pulled out the middle blade spine connected to the hilt, merged the crossguards on both sides, and connected the left and right blades from the crossguard, forming a brand-new sharp sword. In a dual-wielding manner, he concentrated all the energy existing in the atmosphere at the tips of the two sharp swords, gradually forming a huge energy ball.

Seeing his old friend intended to end the battle as soon as possible, Vulture had the same thought. He transformed himself into high-voltage plasma, injected it into the lightning sword, and before Owl could drop that huge energy ball on him, he reversed the blade in advance, thrust the lightning sword in his hand forcefully into the ground, and released the most destructive "Wide-Range Divine Punishment."

The two extreme forces clashed again, and the Atrium shook once more.

"Master—"
"Don't mind it!"

Adam timely called to Queen, who intended to go out and investigate. At the same time, he sequentially stopped the excited behavior of the customers in the bar, telling them to stay calm: "Everyone, it's just the mediation organization performing its official duties. We are just a small guild and can't afford to provoke them. Watch out, curiosity killed the cat."

Saying this, he turned back and gave the bartender behind the counter a wink.

"If you ask me, everyone, we are all sensible people. It's better to sit down obediently and have a drink. The next round is on me, everyone drink to your heart's content, and don't be polite with me."

Looking closely, it wasn't hard to find that Master Adam's back was already soaked with cold sweat. Even without being at the scene, he could feel the magnificent scene and subconsciously broke into a cold sweat for "Free Birds."

Deep within the explosion that had gathered all the energy of the two, the two held their swords and pressed each other. Both of their beliefs reached a peak at this moment; no one had any concerns or hesitation. Both hoped to defeat the strong one before them and head toward the next peak.

"Ready to fall to the ground, Owl!"
"It's far from over!"

After simple greetings, both simultaneously unleashed the [Data Clearing Stream] swordsmanship used for the deciding move. A cold flash of light cut through the middle, and this battle between Dragon and God finally came to an end.

The smoke cleared, and the sunset glow spilled down. A wisp of clear breeze blew past the ears of the two. At this moment, they both slumped to the ground in unison, both having lost their fighting intent and returned to human form.

"Tell me, Owl, why did I lose?"
"You didn't."
"Bullshit! Losing is losing. I won't fail to admit such a thing, so you'd better not use your hypocritical face to flatter and deal with me. I don't take that bait."

Hearing this, Owl had no choice but to say that heart-stabbing sentence: "You didn't obtain the true heritage of Master Muca."
"True heritage? How come I didn't know there was such a thing... what is it?"
"The final ultimate move from the [Data Clearing Stream] that can only be performed with dual swords—Owl Fall, Vulture Return Slash (落枭归鹫斩). Hear the strange name—isn't it talking about us?"

"Heh, isn't it just."

After saying this, Vulture showed a look of compromise, gazed at the sky not too far from them, and let out a sigh: "We're still the same as before, unable to understand him. We truly were defeated by him."

That feeling was like missing the past, and also like thanking the master.

Master Muca, you truly are the most powerful swordsmith in the Atrium. Even knowing you were to bid farewell to this world, before leaving, you didn't forget to forge two swords that were no less than "Kukurin"... one named "Owl" and one named "Vulture."

Thanks to you, those two swords are still as sharp/chilly as before. Just like you back then, they guard the Atrium at all times.

"Soon, our own people will be here."
"Who isn't? Everyone go back to their own homes and find their own mothers. Today's business is all over, treat it as if it never happened."
"Why not call them and have a drink together?"
"Your treat."
"I'll kill you."

The matter reached a perfect resolution.

After returning, we cross-checked information with Master Adam's sister, Jade, and the members of the [Five Nordic Countries Raiders]. We roughly understood the cause and effect of this "Beast-Bird Struggle."

"Although there's still a part of the content we haven't figured out what's going on, it's not important."

These words were problematic, sounding as if those people died in vain. As for how to let their souls find peace, Miss Agnes probably never thought about it.

A group of people sat in the bar around two tables and began to speculate about the motive of the mastermind Plutomon. No need to worry about leaking the news; the arrival of the mediation organization had already caused a significant loss of customers for the bar. It was fortunate that Master Adam was an exception among Guild Masters; since [A Cup of Bar] was established, he had always maintained a neutral state with other guilds and clearly marked his relationships, so he didn't have to face the mediation organization and cross swords with them.

At this point, Owl pulled me aside and asked about my previous situation. I knew he was worried about me, and at the same time, I clearly knew that the situation at that time—even thinking about it now afterward—would still cause me deep fear.

At that time, Mervamon's great sword was about to hit my head. In a moment of desperation, I fell back onto the grass. Before her "Final Strike Slash" could reach me, I swallowed the gift Master Adam gave me—a "Promotion Seed." Subsequently, the red on my body gradually turned to white, and the cloak on my back was dyed with a touch of pink, adding a bit of girlishness to the original "Queen of Flowers and Grass," thus breaking through my limits.

**Rosemon** (蔷薇兽) — **Burst Evolution** — **Rosemon: Burst Mode** (蔷薇兽：爆裂形态).

The Burst Evolution at the critical moment was something I'll never forget in my life.

"And then?"
"Then I discovered a brand-new operation mode."

I said before that Bandai Sakura has never liked fighting or killing. Thus, the network data fulfilled her wish, weakening a part of her combat ability and thereby deepening her charm attribute. For example, giving the opponent a sudden kiss, making them confused and even a bit shy; while she was stunned, amplifying the aura of the cloak, wrapping her in gently, making her fall into a deep sleep.

"So you didn't destroy her?"
"Right."
I didn't deny it.

"Then... where is she?"
"Still in the old place," I explained to Owl. "She was sleeping too soundly, and I couldn't drag her. To be honest, I didn't expect the 'Charm' effect to be so strong. I'll tell you secretly, don't tell the others—I slapped her twice, quite hard, and even that didn't wake her up."

After hearing this, Owl shrugged helplessly and stated: "Well, as long as she's alive."

I didn't know which of us two he was talking about.

Through this battle, the mediation organization successively lost four major generals: Junomon, Ceresmon, Apollomon, and Dianamon. Guild Master Wind of [Windrunner Brigade] and Wing of "Rainbow Starlight" also died honorably. Now [Windrunner Brigade] is taken over by the surviving Plume. Xiao Yong barely defeated the holding-back Master Nagasumi, and the battle between Guild Master Ultra and Marsmon also ended in a draw, so it can be considered they didn't hold back our "Complete Victory Team."

By contrast, the situation on the "Free Birds" side was a bit tragic. Crane was beaten to pieces, her armor and feathers damaged to various degrees, requiring a long time to recover. Dove and Falcon, naturally, didn't need much explanation; both were defeated by their respective opponents and lost convincingly.

"Truly? I don't believe it."
"Believe it or not, it's a fact." Owl told me. "They are all our own people. Usually leave them some face, and don't mention this again in front of them—people need space to grow."

I strongly agreed with his last sentence; I think so too.

"So, this matter is just over like this?"
"Of course not." Owl was very sure about this. "It can only be considered a comma at most; there are still too many things waiting for us to discover and understand. No matter who the ultimate beneficiary is, we at least need to know the reason why they did it."

"Is pure revenge a possibility?"
"Until the truth is clear, everything is possible."

Thus, this mission drew to a rounded comma. From everyone's contemplative posture, it was as if there was still something on the table that we had ignored, or rather, had never noticed, thinking its existence was reasonable.

"Um, let me ask a meddling question." One of the responsibilities of the [Support Position] is to remind. "Does anyone know anything about the newcomer who came to us with the request at the very beginning?"

Everyone present shook their heads—no one knew that newcomer. At the same time, Owl stood up, slapped his forehead, and hit upon a sudden realization: "Right, we haven't determined his identity yet... we all fell into a misunderstanding before, thinking the culprit was Plutomon, but what if he wasn't?"

"Besides, we still don't know what his Digimon image is," I continued to add from the side.

As a representative of [Fang of the Beast King], Xiao Yong, after hearing our introduction, roughly had an idea in his mind and could basically determine the identity of that candidate. He then introduced him to us: "That guy is indeed a newcomer, named Solomon. His digital image is a Psychemon (迷幻兽). He's one of the newcomers who is relatively close to the Master, often running errands for him. He has good popularity in the guild, and we all like him."
