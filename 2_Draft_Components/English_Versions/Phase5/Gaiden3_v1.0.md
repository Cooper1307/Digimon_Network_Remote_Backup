# Side Story 3: Deep Danger Situation (Parts 1-4) (外传三 深险之局)

## (Part 1)

**-By Zero-**

I do not know who I am, nor where I came from. I only know one name: Zero.

The United States federal government bestowed this title upon me. They raised me from a small child to be a network spy, tasked with handling various incidents that threatened national network security. I never disappointed them—not once. Every mission was completed flawlessly, leaving them with nothing to criticize.

Perhaps as a reward, or perhaps to discard me and make way for the younger generation, after I completed my stage-based education, they arranged for me to live in an apartment near the Pentagon and let me work with the Department of Defense.

From that day on, I followed my new superior—Zachary Lopez, a man with a distinct aura of mystery. After resigning from the CIA, he was transferred to the Department of Defense to continue his old trade. It was he who received high-level orders and arranged for an elite network spy like me to represent the United States in the [Raiders] (攻略组). At the same time, it was also he who forbade me from befriending anyone within the group, telling me to always be wary and keep my distance. He even had the nation's cutting-edge technology used to modify Jesmon, allowing me to use my swords to cut through space and create distortions at any time, entering a private space known as the "Zero Domain" (零域) to report to him.

"The Chinese representative's pet (Xiao Wang)—you are watching over (monitoring) it, correct?"

"Correct, sir."

During this past period, to prevent me from privately contacting her pet and harming or disadvantaging her, Dragon had specially created a security measure—moving her pet to a new residence, a natural volcanic lake. The place was remote and unvisited, indeed suitable for concealment. However, her pet didn't like it much there, feeling the water was too hot and uncomfortable, and the terrain was high. Every time she couldn't see Dragon going out on missions with us, her overwhelming longing drove her to sneak back to her original residence behind Dragon's back.

"If I remember correctly, that lake is a dead-water pool without a single fish left. Recently, her master has been busy [Raiding] in the depths. Don't tell me... you've been feeding her?"

In response to his speculation, I simply smiled slightly. "I have no such obligation, sir."

Later, I also explained to him that there had never been fish in the lake. She was always hungry, and at most, she could only dive to the lakebed to scavenge a few small shrimp to fill the gaps in her teeth. I wouldn't feel sorry for her or lend a helping hand, because I am not a person with a "humanitarian" spirit. Originally, I wanted to let her starve to death so I wouldn't have to act. No act means no trace, no trace means Dragon wouldn't find out, and if he didn't find out, he wouldn't suspect me. Of course, he might take his anger out on me because only I knew he kept such a large pet, but that didn't matter—at worst, I'd fight him to the death. If he lost a beloved one and gained a major grievance, I could learn more about one of his weaknesses. This would be advantageous for me and very advantageous for the United States of America. Aside from anything else, at the level of network strategy, we would have a greater advantage over the nation across the ocean. Isn't what we've been doing all for this?

"You have a great sense of awareness, Zero. You know, I'm starting to think more and more highly of you."

"Thank you for your praise, sir. This is only my duty."

"Continue."

The result was quite unexpected; that fellow was remarkably lucky. For some unknown reason, the "Demon Lord of Lust," Lilithmon, appeared on the lake surface without any warning. She was waiting at the bottom of the lake, saw movement on the surface, thought it was food, and without thinking, opened her maw and lunged up, snatching it. Without even having time to chew, she swallowed it whole. It was fortunate she was a Vaccine-type; had she been a Data-type, those data bits would surely have been infected the moment they went down.

"So, she ate a Demon Lord and obtained a portion of her data..."

Actually, it wasn't just a portion; strictly speaking, it was all of it.

I didn't tell him this directly—not because I was afraid of him getting angry, but because I feared he wouldn't be able to handle it and would reach a level of rage that would cause him to drop dead in the network world, leaving not even a corpse behind.

To keep him alive, I could only try to steer the conversation elsewhere, telling him about the situation of the "Leviamon Subjugation War" [Raid]. First was Yu of the [Vanguard Position]; BanchoStingmon couldn't utilize a vanguard's full potential in the water at all and was badly beaten by the "Demon Lord of Envy," losing half his wings. If not for Lana of the [Support Position] coming to his rescue, he might not have made it back alive. Then there was Mante of the [Defense Position]; the mechanical GrandLocomon had difficulty functioning in the deep sea and could only stay in place and take hits, thus finding it hard to escape the fate of being scrapped. Fortunately, his armor was thick enough that the Digicore wasn't damaged, so he didn't perish under Leviamon's massive jaws.

"Stop with the useless talk," Zachary said, his patience always thin. "Tell me about your performance as the [Main Attacker Position], or let's talk about our old friend, that [Substitute Position] who steals the show every time..."

In summary, the [Substitute Position] was still formidable, and the [Main Attacker Position] was still reliable. The former could react in time when the [Vanguard], [Support], and [Defense] were all offline, stepping forward to control the situation—grabbing Leviamon's jaw, curbing its struggles again and again, dragging it out of the water, and sending it into the sky. The latter could make clear judgments, ensuring the former had enough ability to send the target into a position advantageous for his finishing move, emerging from the sea surface ahead of time to make full preparations—first applying all-around suppression with the "Sword Spirits" (剑灵), then dealing the finishing blow with "Aus Generieren" (辙剑审判).

"So, for once in the United Nations Security Council [Raiders], the one in the spotlight wasn't that [Substitute Position], but you, the [Main Attacker]?"

Though it sounded harsh, it was the truth.

"Quite rare, isn't it?"

"Yes, indeed quite rare."

As he spoke, he calmed down, paused for two or three seconds, and then told me: "To tell you the truth, calling you to this 'Zero Domain' wasn't just for you to report on your work. It was mainly to see if you could come over, if you were alive, and if you could log out and return to the real world, come to my office, and see the Minister with me. He has business with you."

Evidently, I happened to be free.

"When?" I asked.

"Anytime," he stated. "If I were you, I'd come after lunch, lest you go onto the battlefield with an empty stomach and the enemy (the Minister) hears your belly growl. Then, your face wouldn't be the only one losing credibility; my face would too."

*I can handle it.*

That was what I really wanted to say. Unfortunately, before I opened my mouth, I remembered a warning from my master: *You are a warrior, not a clown. Think before you speak, and know what should and shouldn't be said—especially in front of your commanding officer.*

Indeed, I have a master too.

I am also human, with my own passions and what one would call feelings. My time isn't entirely occupied by the [Raiders] and the United States of America; I also have private time for learning and enlightenment.

My master is Gankoomon, a fate that was sealed from the moment I initially chose the body of Huckmon.

He came to find me first. At our first meeting, like an old father who had been away for many years, he stood with a stern face and congratulated me on choosing his clumsy disciple's body. I told him then that I wasn't his disciple, but merely a pawn of the US federal government doing their bidding, needing to borrow his disciple's body for a while, and hoped he would be broad-minded and give me this chance. He said it didn't matter; he only recognized the body of Huckmon anyway. As for who was controlling it inside, he didn't care, didn't want to care, and was even less willing to care. His attitude toward this was quite "Obstinate" (顽固), making it impossible to refuse.

His training was extremely strict, reaching a level of harshness—otherwise, it wouldn't have been possible for me to evolve from a Rookie so quickly and rise all the way to a Mega. For example, he was always followed by a pair of Sistermon sisters, both wearing nun's caps—Sistermon Noir and Sistermon Blanc. They looked like two cute mascots, but both were fierce. They would use me as a target for practice. I could block, dodge, or counter-attack, but everything had to be "stop-at-contact"; I couldn't let my sword tip touch them even an inch, because if it did, they would surely die.

With Gankoomon watching, those two sisters were safe. There were several times when it seemed my sword would strike them and I couldn't pull back. Master Gankoomon would appear beneath my sword in an instant, blocking the fatal blow for them, and then he would surely settle the score with me. In the unluckiest cases, I would take a hit from his "Iron Fist Punishment" (铁拳制裁). He called this "Defense Training" for me, intended to hone my resilience. It left me in a pathetic state every time, but fortunately, I persevered tenaciously and didn't get beaten to death.

Occasionally, he would go out with me to complete free-exploration missions sent by higher-ups. We treated these as combat trials and developed a very strong rapport—a master-disciple duo, invincible.

He rarely acknowledged the strong, because in his eyes, there were probably only a few in the entire Digital World who could be called "Strong." Some were human, some were Digimon. Those who earned his recognition naturally became people I couldn't easily provoke. According to the order he gave... there were actually only three: DoruGoramon, HerculesKabuterimon, and LordKnightmon. I could have guessed the first and third—they were Dragon, the Chinese [Raiders] representative, and Owl (He), the leader of the [Holy Knight Regiment] (神圣骑士团). Both were indeed very strong, without question. But that the second would be a bar owner was truly unexpected.

According to Master, the owner, Adam, was the one person who shouldn't be underestimated. His strength was extraordinarily great; he could effortlessly catch the "Iron Fist Punishment" thrown by Master. In contrast, even for me, I had never caught that move even once, getting sent flying by the same technique every time. This made me feel a loss of face and even a bit discouraged.

"Don't lose heart!" he rarely encouraged me. "He is an outlier. A standard species of HerculesKabuterimon would be completely incapable of doing what he does—at least not catching my iron fist so casually..."

Every time I met Adam, it was at the bar, so I never had the chance to see his Digimon form with my own eyes. To go deeper, I knew nothing about him. According to Master's account, Adam's HerculesKabuterimon was twice the size of the natural species found in the Digital World, and his strength left them far behind. He had once been fortunate enough to witness Adam's supernatural strength: at that time, to rescue the stranded Imperialdramon, Adam took on three berserk, giant GranKuwagamon single-handedly. Even with all three attacking together, they were no match for the strength of one person on his side, and the tide was quickly turned.

"The result?"

"One was stomped to death, one had its body crushed, and the other was blasted by his 'Giga Blaster' until not a trace remained. I was watching from the side, and the impact was extraordinarily strong—the scene was quite a shock."

"If it were you in the same battle..."

"It wouldn't have been easy either." He didn't spare himself at all. "Those three lethal things were also outliers, their internal data seemed to have been modified. Defeating them would have definitely taken me ten or twenty seconds longer than him."

Ending a battle with the duration measured in seconds—this is the world of the strong.

## (Part 2)

**-By Zero-**

After lunch, I hurried into the Pentagon to see my superior in his office. I didn't want him to wait, nor did I want the Minister, whom I was meeting for the first time, to wait and have a bad impression.

"Good afternoon, Mr. Zero," the guard boy greeted me proactively. "Long time no see. It's rare to see you here."

"Isn't it," I followed up. "I almost thought I'd been fired."

The truth was, we met once or twice every day and were already like brothers.

I walked quickly through the corridors, turning into one office after another and passing many unfamiliar faces until I finally arrived at my superior's office door. Inside, three voices were laughing and talking, the atmosphere seemingly harmonious. After straightening my clothes, I raised my hand just as I was about to knock, and the door suddenly opened from the inside. What caught my eye was a girl—or rather, a woman whose clothes were just on the youthful side. Looking at her face, she was probably not many years off from me.

"Oh, look who's here."

The Secretary of Defense sat up from the sofa, warmly welcoming my arrival. At the same time, my superior introduced the lady who had just proactively opened the door for me: "This is Miss Judith, your new partner."

"Partner?"

I was very surprised. Zachary knew perfectly well that I always worked alone, so why would he arrange a partner for me? What puzzled me even more was that he hadn't discussed it with me beforehand, which was very unlike his usual style.

While I was thinking, Judith had already extended her hand to greet me: "Hello, Mr. Zero. I am Judith—you can call me Judy. Or, you can just call me LordKnightmon."

I was privately seething and didn't take her hand, nor did I give her a friendly expression, behaving very unamiably. Turning my head, I muttered: "Whatever."

This cold reaction was seen by Judy. She didn't take it personally but said "I'm glad to meet you too" to defuse the awkward scene. Then, with great etiquette, she invited me into the room and thoughtfully poured me a cup of coffee, which tasted as bitter as my current mood. Compared to her open-mindedness and cheerfulness, I was like a petty jerk. An internal self-contempt continued to operate in my heart, and holding it in was quite miserable; I couldn't wait for this meeting to end.

The reality was as I wished—the meeting lasted less than six minutes in total. During that time, the Secretary of Defense didn't waste a single word with us; every sentence was tied to the mission. He and Zachary coordinated to explain the situation to us, and the summary was very simple: my master was dead, and we needed to recover his data.

After learning this, I didn't feel much grief. At most, it was the kind of feeling one has upon graduating and parting ways—not quite sadness, but a certain emptiness in the heart.

The federal government didn't know I had such a master, or rather, in their eyes, I had nothing to do with this species called Gankoomon. I didn't want to bring feelings from my private life into my work, lest they cloud my judgment. So I had always adhered to the good personal rule of "If they don't ask, I don't tell," keeping this matter buried deep in my heart.

"Where did he die?"

"An old server," the Secretary of Defense said first. The detailed address was left to Zachary: "You log in from the Atrium, follow the Network Sea, head straight ahead, pass through a Data Forest and a Data Desert, reach the edge of the desert, find a Scumon, and tell it you are going to the 'Ruins' (废墟). It will guide you there. After entering, head directly to the lower space, 'Coulomb.' Find a way to locate his residual data and bring it back."

This mission sounded easy.

Before leaving the office, Zachary called me and warned: "Don't be careless, Zero. Don't die."

"Don't worry, I won't," I replied as usual. Then, I shifted my gaze to Judy beside me, pointed at her, and facing Zachary, asked: "What about her?"

My behavior provoked Miss Judy's dissatisfaction: "Thank you for your concern, Mr. Zero. Take care of yourself before worrying about others. Honestly, what era is this, to still look down on women..."

She grumbled, pushed my shoulder aside, passed me, and left first. In response, Zachary just shrugged helplessly and said no more.

"Good luck to us."

Closing the office door, I followed Judy's footsteps.

I knew she wanted revenge, so she deliberately kept her distance from me. Later, she even took it upon herself to treat me as her stalker—from an obstacle course walk inside the Pentagon to a light jog, it finally evolved into a street sprint. I didn't catch up with her in one breath but let her run until she was exhausted, leaning against a roadside railing and gasping for air, sparks flying before her eyes, as if suffocating. Only then did I walk up slowly to watch her embarrassment.

"You caught me... are you... satisfied now?"

I didn't respond but stepped forward, pinched her face, leaned in, and told her a settled truth: "No era looks down on women; what's looked down upon is always one's own seeking of death and self-righteousness."

"Aren't you... the same?"

"Stop with the backtalk."

I increased the pressure in my hand and then threw her aside, warning her that in reality, I could let her play out her little temper, but if it came to the Digital World, she had better consider whether she might become a pile of data fragments in the next second, sleeping forever in the world of data without even having a complete soul left behind.

She knelt on the ground, adjusted her chin, and then scrambled up pathetically. "Treating a lady so roughly—you are truly a gentleman, sir."

"Thank you for the praise. Don't mention it."

Our duo was destined not to be peaceful.

The login point was established in a bar in Clarendon named "A Bar." Find the bartender, show our IDs, and he will lead you to the innermost storage room. Inside are two partitioned cabinets, each installed with EDEN haptic equipment. The login environment was absolutely safe.

"Can I trust you?" I asked the bartender.

"Rest assured, sir," his response was sincere. "A secret base designated by the Department of Defense will have no problems."

*I hope so.*

**User ID: NO.00003**

**Digimon: Jesmon**
**Guild: None**

**Confirm Login: YES**

Logging into the Atrium, passing through the firewall, and switching to Digimon form—everything proceeded quite smoothly before meeting the Scumon. Smoothly to an excessive degree, actually; we didn't see a single Digimon on the way. To be honest, this was no longer a matter of being smooth, but of being abnormal.

I asked Judy if she understood the situation. She sighed. "Evidently the same as you."

The two of us cautiously explored the desert. During this time, I thought of many things—mostly unrealistic speculations and hypotheses, with no small amount of self-doubt mixed in.

Meeting the Scumon, it was very unamiable toward our arrival, its mouth full of complaints like "You're late," "This isn't what we agreed on," and "Why did only two come?" None of it made sense to me. Looking at Judy, however, she handled it with ease, answering each of the Scumon's complaints.

"I'm warning you, take us there quickly, or we'll go back and report your lack of cooperation to the Department of Defense. You know their methods—you'll be going to see your friends."

Under her threat, we successfully reached a cave, connected to that old server, logged into the EDEN system, and entered the previously mentioned lower space, Coulomb. This place was a data tomb, and even more, a labyrinth occupied by data blocks of all sizes. No natural gravity or weight could be felt, as if in space—the whole person felt light as a feather, able to move in any direction without fear of falling from a height.

"Let's begin. It's a large place; I suggest we split up."

"Since when did you start making the calls?" I said to Judy like a bad boss.

"I thought I was a person—am I not?"

Her words left me speechless, making me quite embarrassed. Although I was reluctant, the mission came first, so I could only concede: "Fine, we split up. Search carefully, don't miss anything, and keep in touch at all times."

"Thank you for your concern," she started her snide remarks again. "Call me if something happens; I'll come save you. Don't lose your life for the sake of pride—it's not worth it."

She was truly self-righteous.

Wandering alone in the data labyrinth, no living thing could escape my keen eyes. When I say living things, I don't mean living things in the true sense, but a group of Ebemon (机械脑魔). It was just one or two at first. I used my five Digimental Inscription Swords to execute them quickly. Later, the deeper I went, the more I discovered. When hundreds of Ebemon swarmed toward me, I realized I had fallen into their ambush.

The hunter had become the hunted, and the scene suddenly became lively. Weaving through beams of light and rays, I turned on my communication device to call Judy, but under the influence of those fellows, I couldn't establish contact with her. If she were in the same situation as me, she might already be in dire straits.

"Poor thing."

After feeling sorry for her for two seconds, I began to handle these mechanical modified products in earnest.

Zachary had once mentioned in front of me the Digimon experiments conducted in Area 51, saying the US federal government had captured a group of Vademon from the Digital World for research. Later, the entire facility's system was infected by an unknown virus. They couldn't stop the virus from spreading and didn't want it invading the mainstream network, so they had to cut their losses and seal them away. Who would have thought those viruses would invade the then-popular EDEN electronic space in a way humans couldn't imagine, causing the entire Coulomb region to fall. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say humans brought it on themselves.

These Ebemon were quite dangerous—at least, so the data said. Their left hands would release "Brain Rupture" (脑裂), launching a cracking program from the left muzzle toward the opponent's brain to suck out brain data and perform internal analysis, formulating collective combat strategies or even predicting the opponent's next move. Their right hands, "Planet Destroyer" (行星毁灭者), would release massive energy—supposedly enough to destroy a planet instantly, though I doubted if that was true.

I estimated that Master Gankoomon had been besieged by them, outnumbered and unfamiliar with their combat style, leading to his failure and demise. Now it was my turn; I couldn't make the same mistake he did. I had to annihilate them in one go before they gathered more companions.

"Master, watch carefully!"

With the power of the three "Sword Spirits," I collectively formed a large green triangular prism in front of me. Then, I injected my own power into it, and the four of us combined to release a powerful green shockwave from within—"All For One" (我为人人).

Those Ebemon weren't to be trifled with either. Although they hadn't analyzed my internal data, they had gained experience from previous battles and knew I could easily slash them, so none dared get too close. This resulted in the shockwave's energy accumulation being interrupted by the enemy's joint efforts. To prevent this, I specially pulled up the red cape behind me; it could help me resist for a while, allowing me to unleash "All For One" and clear out this rabble.

But I didn't expect an outsider to intervene and interrupt my charging. That outsider was none other than LordKnightmon Judy, who had come here with me. She actually stood on the side of the Ebemon, silently appearing behind me and joining them and the seemingly endless army of Knightmon under her command to launch a dead-end siege against me. The combination of long-range and close-range combat was very comprehensive. I could handle ten or twenty, but if hundreds or thousands came, I would truly find it hard to cope. Experiencing dual pressure from both physical and psychological levels simultaneously, I was momentarily unable to attend to everything. At this rate, I would sooner or later be forced into a corner.

"I'm sorry, Master!"

If you can't win, retreat—this was the last move he taught me. Although the process would be a bit pathetic, it could to a large extent avoid a portion of the danger, thereby preserving a life.

Preserve your life, and you can make a comeback. Master hadn't remembered this most basic of principles before his death. Perhaps it was his unyielding and obstinate character that led to his defeat, or perhaps his repertoire simply didn't include this so-called last move of "Retreating is the best path," only "Giving one's life in a desperate struggle."

In a daze, I seemed to hear again that sentence he often said to me: *Kid, don't die! Remember, if you die, no one will cry for you, no one will feel sad, and even less will anyone seek revenge for you.*

The way he said it, as if anyone would if *he* died.

Yet, he was actually right.

## (Part 3)

**-By Zero-**

The server entrance was set on the edge of the desert, where no one visited and no one would disturb—no matter how much noise was made, no one would notice. It was a perfect place for handling someone in the way. Unfortunately, that someone was me. After thirteen years of faithful service, risking my life for the nation and solving countless network security incidents, I was ultimately betrayed by my own superiors.

They wanted me dead because I was too elite.

If I didn't die, the spies ranked behind me wouldn't move up. If they didn't move up, the manpower would always be sufficient, and future new spy training plans would repeatedly fall through. The nation wouldn't allocate new funds, and they would have no way to exploit loopholes for embezzlement. Since it involved their interests and I was a social "invisible person" with no family and no friends, I naturally became that lamb to be slaughtered. It wasn't convenient to act in reality for fear of leaving evidence, so they used the mission as a pretext to lure me into the Digital Space and bring me to this place for a secret execution.

My master's death was merely a catalyst, or rather, an accident.

Using a data loophole in the network, he had previously discovered a problem with the Department of Defense's financial report for the last quarter. He conducted a private investigation and saw through their despicable trick of using me as a cover, intending to meet them to demand an explanation for his dear disciple—me. He didn't expect to be stood up by those scumbags and instead be met with the guns and cannons of a group of Ebemon.

The reason I knew this was because the culprit stood before me and confessed proactively. I hadn't expected them to come in person, probably fearing that their lapdog Judy wouldn't lead me to the right place.

"Look who's here."

That familiar voice came from the body of Craniummon. If he was the Secretary of Defense, then the Duftmon beside him must be Zachary.

These two rarely visited the Digital World, so I assumed they wouldn't be too troublesome. In a one-on-one duel, I had full confidence I could beat them. But the current situation was different—I had just escaped from a group of Ebemon's guns and cannons, heavily wounded and hit by multiple "Planet Destroyers," fortunately saved by my cape taking the hits. It had now honorably sacrificed itself, turning to ash and leaving me. Simultaneously, I had taken multiple "Brain Ruptures," causing certain problems with my mental state; the visual feed could cut out at any time, and I was at risk of being pincered by them from front and back and killed.

Fortunately, there was a firewall between the Digital World and the external server, which prevented the external virus from invading the network's interior—in other words, it blocked the Ebemon army. LordKnightmon Judy and her Knightmon were completely unaffected, as they originated from this side. They caught up with me from behind. Seeing me blocked by the two leaders and failing to escape, the heart that had been in their throats finally eased.

The Secretary of Defense said with a dark face: "You're late, Judy."

"My apologies, sir," her apology was sincere. "He was too fast, I... I did my best."

"Don't let it happen again." Zachary changed back from "Leopard Mode" to human form, speaking before the Secretary of Defense could, pardoning his subordinate's lapse while also preempting his superior's complaint to avoid turning on their own and letting me slip away.

I had to admit, Zachary was always shrewd and considered problems comprehensively; he was a natural "Strategist." It wouldn't be easy to escape from under his nose, even if the current me wasn't the me of before—dealing with the three of them plus a group of Knightmon would be a hard battle.

While fleeing in Coulomb, I unexpectedly obtained my master's Digicore. It was like a spirit wandering in space, looking for its master—me. It proactively approached the wounded me, entered my body, and merged with me. Subsequently, my body underwent a very noticeable change: the red and white across my entire body were swapped, and the three-in-one "Sword Spirits" merged with Master's "Hinokamuy" (火神威), forming a brand-new spiritual armament attached to my back.

**Jesmon, Evolve! —— Jesmon GX!**

Master's voice echoed in my ears, and I suddenly felt filled with power. Using this momentum, I immediately retaliated against these people who dared think they could take my life.

I utilized my main weapon, the "Endless Gauntlet" (无尽手套), switching it into forms like sword, fist, and shield to target the three of them. The Secretary of Defense, Craniummon, was old and experienced, immediately unleashing "God Breath" (神之庇佑), using the magic shield "Avalon" to make my attacks ineffective for a short period. Seizing this chance, Zachary and Judy attacked from front and back, unleashing "Aussterben" (毁天灭地) and "Urgent Fear" (急迫恐惧) respectively. The intense beams of light and the close-range shockwaves left me with only a choice between two sides for protection; no matter which I blocked, the other would hit. In that case, I might as well abandon defense and put all my energy into the subsequent counter-attack.

"Lend me your strength, Master!"

Focusing my gaze on my direct superior, Zachary, I drove the brand-new tactical armament, concentrating energy at a single point to unleash the ultimate technique inherited from Master—"Seiken Metsuha" (圣拳灭破). A series of sub-light-speed strikes, swift and graceful, allowed Zachary in the form of Duftmon to feel the full weight of his subordinate's resentment, leaving him no room to escape and personally burying him in this data desert to be carried away by the wind and sand.

"Father—!"

Judy suddenly cried out behind me, and only then did I realize I had just done something foolish.

Her full name was Judith Lopez. Currently, she stood woodenly in place, unmoving and wordless, fallen into deep collapse, unable to accept the truth for the moment.

Looking at her, my sword hesitated. If killing a beast was for self-preservation, then killing the beast's daughter would surely be worse than a beast.

After only three seconds, Secretary Craniummon seized the opportunity. He lunged behind me, spinning his magic spear at high speed and unleashing his prized technique, "End Waltz" (终结华尔兹). I intended to pull away quickly to dodge the massive shockwave, but a turn found me facing Judy; though I couldn't read the expression on LordKnightmon's face, I could still sense her pain and resentment through her trembling breath.

"Give me your life, you executioner!"

She coordinated with Secretary Craniummon, releasing four ribbon blades from her armor and unleashing "Spiral Masquerade" (回旋华舞) for my reception.

The situation was the same as before; I didn't dodge, instead taking these two sustained damage sources head-on, showing my most resilient side to explain to Judy: "I didn't want to do this. Your father... Zachary forced me."

She couldn't hear my words, still using the "Pile Bunker" (冲击锥) on her right wrist to hammer my hard body over and over. For the current me, it was like scratching an itch, unable to cause any damage. Even if she sent more Knightmon to help, they would be cleared with a single slash. She knew this, yet maintained her persistence, swearing to avenge her father—it was clear how deep the feelings were between father and daughter.

To get rid of her, I had to be rough with her one more time. I swung my sword, sending her back into the embrace of the Knightmon army, then quickly turned, catching the Secretary's magic spear with my left hand and pointing the blade in my right hand toward him.

"I am not an executioner!" I stared fiercely at the culprit before me and told Judy: "He is!"

At this point in the performance, a clown would usually take off the mask and admit the truth—the same for the Secretary of Defense. He flipped the magic spear, turning the other end to thrust at me. I held my sword horizontally in my right hand, blocking his attack and entering a stalemate with him.

"I don't deny it," the Secretary of Defense said in person. "But you must also admit it."

I was furious, immediately roaring at him: "Admit what? That I am an executioner? Wasn't that thanks to you? Haven't I done enough dirty work for you before!"

Since he had already admitted it personally, I didn't need to waste any more words with him. Adhering to the philosophy that "betrayers must die," I flicked aside his magic spear with my sword, turned back, and delivered another slash, letting him personally experience the feeling of the body being split in two.

"You shouldn't have treated me like this."

Unfortunately, he left too quickly to hear these last words of mine.

After dealing with the two people who betrayed me, the only things standing in my way were a group of Knightmon and Judy, who led them.

"It's not over yet, Zero!"

Judy threw harsh words at me. I didn't respond because, from my point of view, this game was already over.

Without a doubt, the winner was me.

The outcome was decided, the player had left the stage, and a pawn shouldn't become a sacrifice in a game—whether for her or for me. Moreover, they were no match for me; even with a massive numerical advantage, they couldn't bridge the inherent gap in power. Continuing to fight had no meaning; her persistence was to avenge her father, while I had lost all reason for battle. So, I chose to let her go, sparing her life and showing a rare moment of gentleness. This was the first and last time.

"I don't hate you, Judith Lopez."

Leaving those words, I entered that desert again without looking back.

Dragging my scarred body and following the traces left by Scumon when it slipped away, I headed forward through the wind and sand. During this time, I thought about many things. This ordeal was exhausting and wounding, both physically and mentally. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say I had lost everything.

The hollow in my chest throbbed with continuous pain, from which my internal data kept gushing out. A portion had been infected by the virus carried by the Ebemon. Fortunately, when this body and underwent modification, it was equipped with a data reconstruction program; as long as there were supplementary data, it could function, transforming them into internal data compatible with my body, filling my wounds and discharging the infected virus, allowing me to regain vitality. My master's Digicore was the best supplementary data. If it hadn't been for it to sustain my life, I wouldn't have lasted this long.

Looking at the current situation, returning to reality was impossible. Judy clearly hadn't forgiven me; she would blame me for the Secretary's and her father's deaths, and the federal government would give her an answer. By then, I would not only have to bear the crime of being a murderer but also be called a traitor by the uninformed, suffering humiliation from all sectors of society. I'd never have a good day in this life.

Continuing to wander in the Digital World, I still had nowhere to go. The "Zero Domain" was forcibly blocked, and there were eyes planted by the federal government within the major guilds. I believed they would soon issue a warrant for me. When that happened, not only them but also a considerable number of greedy people would stand on the opposite side of justice, executing that so-called justice for another nation and another government.

Danger was everywhere, and everywhere would become my final resting place, leaving me no choice.

Thinking of this, my damaged body finally reached its limit. It pathetically collapsed in this desert, failing to make any expected response no matter how I tried to control it.

Gradually, my thoughts were blown away by the wind and sand, my will was submerged, and I lost my proper consciousness, experiencing the feeling of the soul ascending to heaven. In that moment, dreaming back to the beginning, it was as if Gankoomon was by my side, swearing and cursing with a heart full of passion, teaching me roughly as he always did. It felt very intimate and very nostalgic.

For a moment, I even felt that I had truly become Jesmon, truly had such a strict master, truly laid down the burden on my shoulders, said goodbye to the US federal government, and transformed from a tool into a living person.

## (Part 4)

**-By Zero-**

When I woke up, I found myself in a tea garden, my body back in human form, lying on a rattan chair.

The owner of the tea garden sat beside me. He was an old acquaintance, the one I used to constantly target. With him there, my safety was guaranteed; I needn't worry about the federal government putting a bounty on my head in the Atrium, because no fool was willing to become his enemy—except for the former me, who didn't know the height of the heavens.

Seeing me wake up, he put on a sour face, casually picked up the teapot on the table, and poured me a cup of bitter tea that could scald me to death. With arms folded across his chest, mouth twisted, and eyebrows furrowed, looking as if I owed him thirty thousand US dollars, he wore a face that was quite unwelcoming as he greeted me: "You're actually still damn well alive."

"Sorry to disappoint you."

His appearance surprised me greatly, but also made me feel a touch of joy and tension.

"How long was I unconscious?" I asked.

"How should I know," he stated.

That was the harmonious way we got along.

"Explain why you were sleeping in the desert."

"Explain why you rescued me."

Our way of getting along was also very friendly.

"I don't pick up trash. It was Mante."

Subsequently, he explained the situation to me one by one. To summarize simply: he and Mante had gone together to execute a [Raid] mission, defeated the domain ruler Daemon (究极魔兽), liberated a new Digital region, and returned in triumph. While passing through the desert, they found I was blocking their way.

"Stop being so sentimental," he interrupted. "We have eyes—we'd actively avoid trash."

The last battle with Leviamon had severely damaged Mante's GrandLocomon; after repairs proved fruitless, he had to announce its retirement and would no longer provide carrying services.

"I heard from the Russian guy at 'Mousse Mine' that the higher-ups are building a brand-new version of the database for him. It's a massive project and will take a long time. So, he has temporarily changed his form to HiAndromon. Where he got it, I'm not clear—you can go ask the leader of the [Steel Legions] (钢铁雄兵) guild if he's willing to tell you."

"Where is he?"

"Who, Mante? He was in a hurry to get back and submit the performance test report, no time to care about you."

So, he handed me, this broken piece of trash, to Dragon, which was why I appeared here.

Afterward, Dragon told me: "I've swapped positions with him."

"Why?" I was very puzzled.

"Asking the obvious—what kind of defense could a HiAndromon provide? Until his next version is developed, I'll be [Defense] and he'll be [Substitute]. Your rear will be guarded by me."

That last sentence made me break into a cold sweat; I could only say it was the result of a conditioned reflex.

"There is no US representative anymore."

"What?"

"The era of the five is over, Dragon." I couldn't help but sigh and confessed to him: "From now on, the UNSC [Raiders] only has four. Good luck, continue to explore, continue to be loyal to your countries, and perform your duties as tools. You are burdened with unlimited expectations—don't disappoint the people above, don't disappoint the people of your nations, and don't... disappoint me."

He snapped his fingers in front of me, interrupting. "Do you know what you're saying?"

"Of course," I stated. "I haven't reached the age of confusion yet."

I told him about my ordeal truthfully. Unlike my previous attitude, this time I was full of sincerity; after all, he was no longer my enemy, and there was no need to be constantly against him as before.

I focused on the matter of his pet sneaking back to her original residence, advising him to find her as soon as possible and arrange a new home to prevent the federal government from causing her trouble. In exchange, I hoped he could provide me with a relatively safe environment to continue surviving. If possible, I hoped to negotiate with the Chinese government through him to seek political asylum so I could return to reality and completely become a person again.

"Forget it. The Chinese government doesn't accept a dog that has bitten its master, even if that dog has no teeth." He rejected me righteously, then shifted the topic: "Do you like soaking in hot springs? I'll let you soak to your heart's content."

I didn't expect him to be even harder to break than me—hearing him say "thank you" was like reaching the heavens. However, he did express his gratitude with actions: he very generously gave me the volcanic lake previously used to house his pet, allowing me to hide there to convalesce and restore my body to its original state as quickly as possible.

"The Five... the Five are indispensable."

According to him, as long as I was still an American, the [Raiders] would still recognize my identity. With the backing of multiple other nations, there was no fear of threats from the US government.

"What if the [Raiders] face retaliation?"

"I will step in."

As he spoke, a trace of confidence naturally crossed his face, deeply shocking my heart. "It's been a long time since I've found a worthy opponent. Let them come—the more, the better. My skills aren't meant for hoarding."

Behind his peerless arrogance lay immense energy. Formidable and terrifying power, much like the DoruGoramon symbolizing terror and trepidation—having endured thousands of battles and always remaining undefeated. Every battle was an absolute affirmation of his own strength. Such a person, such a Digimon, had no reason to retreat, no reason to fear retaliation from others, and no reason not to protect the weak—for he *was* the strong.

We were once rivals and enemies. Now it seemed I was the one clinging to a higher branch. This time, he didn't just help me; he saved my life, preserved my face, kept my dignity, and didn't make me crawl on the ground begging like a truly fallen master. This was his greatest mercy to me.

I didn't know how to thank him, so I could only make a promise: in the future, I would never again monitor him or his pet. I would be duty-bound to help in any way needed.

"I don't need that last one... but the first one, you can keep appropriately."

His meaning was to have me take care of his pet for him. It just so happened that it wasn't convenient for me to show my face outside for the time being, and I couldn't participate in the [Raiders] side either—to be frank, I hadn't yet emerged from the shadow of being betrayed by my nation. And the so-called "taking care of" was nothing more than feeding fish and keeping watch to prevent others from plotting against his pet. Think about it carefully, and it wasn't a bad job.

"You don't plan to change her residence?"

"It's a 'she'—she is a person." He spoke in a solemn voice. "A young girl has her own pursuits; we grown men shouldn't be overbearing. If she wants to stay in the old place, let her. Going deep is too dangerous, and I'm not at ease either."

I advised him: "What's there to fear? She swallowed a Lilithmon before."

Without thinking, and without even hearing clearly, he stated: "Eating that kind of dirty stuff is unhealthy... What did you say? She ate what?!"

I truthfully repeated it: "The 'Demon Lord of Lust,' Lilithmon. Don't worry—she's a Vaccine-type, so she's not afraid of being infected. But it's best to be careful; if she develops a lustful heart for you, I can't help."

"Nonsense. And it's not like you *could* anyway."

With that, he stroked his chin and looked me up and down. Then he leaned in and asked: "What about you? If she has eyes for you and develops a lustful heart..."

"I'll be at your disposal."

"That won't be necessary."

I hadn't expected him to respond like that.

"What did you just say? Say it again."

He raised an eyebrow and stated: "Let nature take its course. Accept a relationship ten years younger."

*Relationship?* I didn't think one day I would harvest such a thing, which was completely unrelated to me. The role of the old father was played very well, but unfortunately, I didn't want to be his son-in-law.

"Fine. I'll just pretend I didn't hear that."

"As you wish," he didn't continue to make things difficult for me. "Just pretend I didn't say anything either."

At the moment, one problem remained before me: after Gankoomon's death, where did the Sistermon sisters go?

In the previous confrontation, I didn't remember the Secretary of Defense or Zachary mentioning them. Could that prove they hadn't met? Gankoomon, as usual, had placed them in a safe area, prioritizing their safety before going to meet his fate alone. If so, then they must still be alive.

"Dragon, have you seen a pair of Sistermon sisters?"

"If you mean the two new laborers at 'Mousse Mine,' then I have indeed seen them."

*Third time's the charm.* I didn't want to hear that name from him again.

Mousse Mine was originally an independent server used to reform network prisoners, which humans found very difficult to enter without external connections. The Digimon inside were just like me—all modified, and each one was fierce, terrifying, and a genuine monster.

My master Gankoomon had once had the fortune to go there, back then to save a friend of his. Those in charge of the guard work were a group of Deathmon (死亡兽). They gave Master a lot of trouble—clashing with them, Master gained no advantage. "Iron Fist Punishment" was easily neutralized, "Quaking Table" was pinned back to the ground, and finally, after using all his strength, he unleashed the move "Gijin! Shinkou! Shinkaku! Oyaji!" (地神！神鸣！神驰！亲父！) to bring down "Hinokamuy" for heavenly retribution.

Afterward, Master, dragging his weary body, successfully rescued his friend. Unfortunately, on the way back, they were discovered by three giant GranKuwagamon on patrol and had their path blocked. Fortunately, it wasn't just them who were blocked; Adam, who had also come to rescue his fellow citizens and was also stopped by them, was there too. To protect the Imperialdramon behind him, Adam finally defeated them three-to-one. At the same time, Master realized that even among humans, there existed strong ones who could rival him.

I suddenly asked Dragon: "Who is the 'Russian guy at Mousse Mine' you mentioned?"

"Just a Russian guy, a proxy for the [Steel Legions] (钢铁雄兵) guild—not anyone major. Why? Do you have business with him? Don't tell me you want to go rescue those 'Sistermon sisters' you just mentioned."

"They are my family."

With a sense of shame, I successfully uttered these words I had previously kept buried in my heart. Immediately, they were met with his rebuttal: "Nonsense. When did those two Chinese girls become your family?"

I was very surprised and retorted: "They are human?"

"Nonsense! Are you the only one in the world allowed to be!"

"That's not what I meant..."

I explained the situation to him. After hearing it, he nodded slightly in recognition. "Treating them like family... I suppose that's understandable. However, I can responsibly tell you that they are indeed human, not Digimon."

"How can you tell?"

Dragon told me that the sisters had once suffered severe brain damage in a car accident and had become persistent vegetative states. Their father was a well-known Chinese Digimon scholar who didn't want his daughters to leave him, so according to their brainwave frequencies, he wrote a new set of Digital algorithms to allow his daughters to be reborn in the Digital World. One could tentatively understand them as people who had no 'User Identification Medal' but wouldn't be recognized as BUGs by the Atrium system.

I asked him again: "How do you know all this?"

"It so happens," he admitted proactively, "the director of that hospital is actually my distant cousin—the one you all know as the leader of the [Imperial Dragon's Nest] (御龙巢穴) guild..."

*ShineGreymon: Burst Mode (BM).*

I hadn't expected such a relationship existed between them.

"Can you come help me?"

"What, afraid the Russian guy will play tricks on you and seek revenge? Don't be silly. He doesn't have the time..."

"Just say if you'll help or not."

One sentence, straight and to the point. Not just for me, but for him as well.

He picked up the teacup on the table, brought it to his mouth, took a small sip, and unhurriedly spoke that sentence full of helplessness yet extremely powerful—"Only the weak are left in the mine." In other words, the strong inside had long since been taken care of by him.

He had helped me a huge favor again. I would remember his kindness, and him as a person.

"Hey, where are you going?"

"To save them."

He gave a wry smile. "What's the hurry? Finish this cup of tea before you go."

"The tea is too hot. I'll drink it when I get back."
