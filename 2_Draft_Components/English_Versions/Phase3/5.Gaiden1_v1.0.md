# Gaiden I: Raider Rescue Operation

## (Part I) - By Jade

That day, I had just finished an overseas assignment and was flying back to Paris.

Outside the airport, people from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were waiting for me. They whisked me away to a secret location—I wasn't sure exactly where, partly because of my terrible sense of direction. The entrance was a carousel in an abandoned amusement park. From there, it was a downward spiral; the winding stairs made my legs shake, and I nearly tumbled several times. I wanted to complain, but I knew these people wouldn't listen. To them, I was just a tool, and the complaints of a tool are never important.

At the bottom, maybe thirty or forty meters underground, lay a fallout shelter. I followed a corridor to the innermost room, where a screen displayed a single English word: "WELCOME."

"What's this? A surprise party?"

A cold-blooded government official handed me a glass of red wine and an EDEN sensory rig. I was instructed to log in under my own identity; "important guests" were already waiting inside.

"Why use this setup?" I asked.

"To prevent your login point from being compromised," he replied—a rare answer. "This mission is critical. It’s a diplomatic crisis, and we need a fallback. If the system deems you're in danger, we’ll trigger the extraction protocol, force-pull your data, and log you out."

They made it sound so vital. I wondered where this protectiveness was during my previous missions. Regardless, a job is a job, especially when it comes from the top.

**[Trial ID: NO.00007]**
**[Holder: Aurélie Lefebvre]**
**[Raider Identity: Jade]**
**[Digimon: BanchoStingmon]**
**[Guild: The 'Drink' Bar]**

I logged in. Let’s see what kind of "good news" was waiting for me.

After the usual three-second lag, I materialized in the center of the **"Raider Conference."** Every eye in the room turned toward me, as if I were some curious specimen in a zoo.

"16:09 Paris time. Am I late?"

"No, just in time."

My old acquaintance, **Metal**, stood up to greet me warmly. Beside him sat another familiar face—**Dragon**.

"Aren't you going to say hello?" I asked Dragon.

He stared at me for a long time without speaking. I sent him a wink, and he looked genuinely stunned. It’s hard to imagine anyone resisting a blonde's charm, but perhaps he just didn't have a taste for Caucasians.

The seat for the US representative, **Zero**, was marked with an "ABSENT" tag. Figures. No one really understands that guy—or wants to. Every time we cross paths, he remains a silent, brooding enigma.

"It's better he’s not here," a voice said.

**Lana**, the UK representative, materialized and spoke to me from the front row. "Even if he showed up, he'd probably just parrot his superiors: 'My **Jesmon** only knows how to fight, not rescue. Find someone else.'"

I couldn't help but agree.

Among the "UN Big Five," only Lana and I were women. Metal, Dragon, and Zero were just mindless fighting machines—cold fighting machines with zero sense of romance or atmosphere. I shared no common ground with them. Whenever the Big Five went on joint explorations, I usually stuck with Lana. At least she had a better sense of direction; I couldn't find my way out of my own front door without a map.

"How are you and **Poseidon**?" I asked.

"Check this out." She showed me her ring. Her boyfriend, the Guild Master of **"Atlantis,"** had finally proposed last week.

"Gosh! You're going to be a Guild Master's wife!"

"Shh—it’s even better than that." She whispered that the proposal happened in the real world. She never imagined her online partner would be a member of the British Royal Family. I didn't press for details; some secrets are best kept.

"And you said yes?"

"The ring is already on. There's no escaping now."

I'll admit to a twinge of jealousy, but I swallowed it. I was happy for her.

The room filled up. Seventeen representatives—enough to prove the severity of the situation.

The moderator appeared and laid out the mission: **Rescue.** The South Korean Raider had vanished during a routine exploration. It had been over three days since last contact—officially a security crisis. Nineteen countries had responded, though most just wanted to "evaluate" before committing their representatives.

"Why not let those already exploring the area check it out?" the Italian representative asked.

The moderator shook his head. "**Siegfried** (the German representative) went to check. He’s also missing."

"So we’re rescuing both?" Metal asked.

"More than that. We also need to find four members of **'The Holy Knights'** guild. Earlier today, a **Rasielmon** suffered a data anomaly and became a fallen **Raguelmon**. It started as an internal guild matter, but their 'Targeted Raider Group' chased the rampaging beast into the same sector where the Korean and German Raiders vanished. They haven't been heard from since."

"What kind of sector are we talking about?" asked **Ruki**, the Japanese representative.

"A desert. Empty. Nothing but sand."

"Count me out then," Lana said, withdrawing the UK's support. "Have fun, everyone."

I couldn't blame her. Her guild, **"Atlantis,"** consisted of aquatic Digimon. A desert was certain death for them.

"What's the danger level?" Dragon asked.

"Undetermined. For now, we are treating it as **Level Terminal**."

The room went cold.

"Are you joking? Terminal Level? You want us to die!?"

"Exactly! No one’s going to risk that!"

The Italian and Canadian representatives voiced their protest. The "Nordic Five" along with the representatives from Arabia, India, Egypt, and Australia all shook their heads and withdrew. In the end, only Metal, Dragon, Ruki, the Spanish representative, and I remained.

The moderator looked disappointed. He told us to check with our superiors before finalizing the decision.

"No need," Dragon said, raising his hand. "China is in."

"You sure you don't want to discuss it?"

"Discussion is useless," Dragon replied sharply. "By the time they finish their meeting, those two will be data dust. They'll tell me not to go anyway. Better to move now—retrieving corpses is better than nothing."

His words moved me. I didn't know he had such a human side.

"You can't go alone without a driver," Metal added.

"I can fly."

"Flying isn't as comfortable as a private express. Let me give you a lift."

"Save a seat for me," I said, moving to sit beside them. "You'll need a blonde to keep watch—and an excellent **Vanguard**."

I was the designated Vanguard of the Big Five, and I wasn't giving up that title.

Metal smiled and gave me a high-five. "Perfect. The three of us, then."

"Where are the other two?" Metal asked, looking around.

"Gone," Dragon grunted. He began recalibrating his transport rig according to the mission data. "The Japanese fox and the Spanish oarfish got cold feet. One’s a card player, the other’s a diver—unreliable. Better they didn't come; they’d only hold us back."

He said "us," not "me." That was high praise from Dragon. He rarely acknowledged anyone, save for Zero. Even the ten Guild Masters didn't impress him; he only showed respect to my brother, Adam, mostly to get out of paying his bar tab.

"You seem confident," I noted.

"I’ll do better than those two (the Korean and German reps), at least."

Rescue missions differ from standard raids. The lineup was set: Metal as **Extraction**, myself as **Cover**, and Dragon as **Rearguard**.

We were transported to the coordinates. Our forms shifted: I became the aerial **BanchoStingmon**; Metal transformed into the massive armored train, **GrandLocomon**; and Dragon became his terrifyingly powerful form—**Dorugoramon**.

"All aboard, partners. The express is leaving the station."

Dragon and I clung to the back of the armored locomotive. With a blast of the whistle, we surged forward. The mission had begun.

First, an apology. I kept certain things from the Raiders.

I was raised in the Russian military; my father is a high-ranking general and the Guild Master of **"Iron Legions."**

I had slept in until noon. When I woke, I found him staring at his tablet, his brow furrowed deep enough to crush a fly. I asked what happened. He said it was serious and turned the screen around.

The video showed a group of **Myotismon**, bearing the insignia of the "Pervert Party." They were in a dark, shaded forest, dragging a shivering **Angewomon** from a coffin. They bound her with "Bloody Whips" and swarmed her with "Grisly Wing." They tore at her wings, ripped away her mask, and sank their fangs into her flesh, treating her like livestock.

"Gosh... what is this?" I could barely watch.

"Look what happens next..."

The perverts injected her with their viral code. The small Vaccine-type Digimon underwent a horrific mutation—evolving into **Ofanimon: Falldown Mode**.

"A fallen angel... slaughtering demons."

The **Flame Hellscythe** reaped the lives of the Myotismon, her silhouette drifting deeper into the forest.

"So, we have a job?"

He didn't deny it. "Think of the safety risks... a rampaging fallen angel wandering the Digital World, killing indiscriminately..."

"Fine, fine. I'll go."

But then he added something crucial: "Do not mention this to any of the Raiders."

I drank a glass of milk to steady my nerves. "Why not?"

"The legality of the recording is... questionable."

Typical. He had been spying on them. This was Russian intelligence, not to be shared. You never know how other nations will react.

I volunteered to be the driver for Jade and Dragon out of guilt.

We surged across the desert on the tracks I laid down myself. A sandstorm hit us, blinding and fierce. I slowed down so the two on my back could search for survivors.

"Found them yet?" I called out. "Am I going too fast?"

"Keep this pace," Dragon replied.

"We need time," Jade added.

The desert was empty, save for a few stray **Tortomon**—likely refugees fleeing something terrible.

Soon, Jade spotted a South Korean flag. We found the Raider, **Lanshen**, half-buried in the sand. His left side was digitizing, and his **MirageGaogamon** armor was shattered beyond repair. His core was intact, but he’d need days of treatment to work for the Korean government again.

As we loaded him aboard, Jade touched his armor. "**Chrome Digizoid**... shredding this requires at least a Mega-level attacker. If there’s only one of them, we might be outmatched."

"Have some faith," Dragon scoffed. "Chrome Digizoid isn't that rare among Megas. It’s nothing special."

His words reminded me of my own goal. Next time, I wanted to shift into a Chrome Digizoid form. Only Russia had the "persuasive" power to force developers to leave a bug in the code for that kind of mod.

Dragon looked around. "Metal, I found another piece of metal."

It was a terrible pun, but it worked. We found **Siegfried**, the German Raider. He was a **Slayerdramon** now, but he was in bad shape—riddled with holes. More disturbingly, his German flag cape was missing its yellow section, cut away clean by something other than physical face. His core was damaged. He was dying.

"What kind of thing can take down two Chrome Digizoid Megas?" Jade asked.

"A monster. Or Dragon," I said, glancing at him. "Or you, if you tried harder."

"Me? I'd need something to pierce that armor first."

"Those stingers on your arms don't count?"

"I could scratch it," she admitted. "But I’d need the Boss's strength to punch through."

True. Very few could match Adam’s raw power. Dragon was one of them—an undefeated king of accidents.

Siegfried muttered something to Dragon before losing consciousness. Time was running out.

"Get him on board!" I shouted. "We have more passengers!"

"Forget it," Dragon said, his voice grim. "The members of 'The Holy Knights' have already boarded the express to the underworld. You can't catch them."

"Who’s the driver of that express?" I asked.

"A fallen archangel..."

Before he could finish, red laser beams rained down from the sky. The attack was sudden. I jerked my armored chassis sideways, shielding Jade. Dragon vanished from his spot.

"DRAGON!" Jade screamed.

"Don't be stupid! He’s fine!"

Dragon hated sneak attacks. He wouldn't miss a chance to show off. He vanished into the sky, his massive wings carrying him toward the lasers.

We loaded the unconscious Siegfried. I don't have much sympathy for him—he was always looking for excuses when he failed. But duty is duty.

High above the clouds, the culprit revealed itself: **Ordinemon**. A massive, grotesque fusion of Raguelmon and Ofanimon: Falldown Mode. A sick mockery of order.

Its wing-arms seized Dragon, pinning his limbs. It dragged him to its face, opening its maw to gather energy for its **End of the World** blast. A direct hit would be terminal.

But Dragon wouldn't just sit there. He used his wings to break the grip, then spun his body, slamming his mace-like tail into the monster’s head, grounded it instantly.

As the wings tried to seize him again, I surged forward on my tracks. My massive locomotive wheels ground into the monster’s wings, my engine glowing with energy. I unleashed a **Destructive Impact**, grinding the black hands into data.

"Jade, we have to finish this!" I shouted.

"On it!" She took flight from my back, signaling for me to move the survivors to safety.

I am an Extraction Specialist. I knew when to leave. I had faith in them.

## (Part III) - By Dragon

Before I get to the main story, let me tell you about a girl named **Wang**.

She was a fellow guild member who looked up to me. She was always pestering me to take her as a disciple. I refused at first, telling her to follow the Guild Master instead. But she was stubborn. In the end, I let her follow me.

Then came **Lucemon: Falldown Mode**. She saved my life, taking the **Dead or Alive** blast meant for me. I killed the bastard, but it wasn't a victory. Her Trial Badge was destroyed. She became a **Ouryumon**, unable to log out.

She hid in a cave by a lake, thinking she was protecting me from the "trouble" she’d cause. She thought I didn't know she was there. But fish don't just appear in a stagnant lake—I put them there. I just wanted to make sure she was eating. Nothing more.

Anyway, back to business.

GrandLocomon ground the monster’s wings, and Jade moved in to support. I didn't need it, but I didn't want to hurt them with my own splash damage.

"Fast work, Vanguard," I teased Jade. "Hope you didn't pull a muscle."

She rolled her eyes. "Got a plan to kill this thing?"

"Plans aren't thought up," I said. "They're *done*."

I stopped thinking. I focused on the enemy. No strategy. Just raw power.

"Ready, Jade? It’s getting up."

"Let's go!"

We blurred toward the target. Jade struck first, using her head-butt to disrupt the monster’s energy gathering. She followed up with explosive mechanical insects to blind it.

I gathered flame in my hands, targeting the green and purple orbs on its wings. Jade triggered her arm drills. We punched through the creature together, forcing it back into the mountainside. Its cores shattered. Its head was a mess of data.

"Your turn, Dragon!"

"Watch closely."

Ordinemon used its last reserves for one final **End of the World** blast. I met it head-on, my claws gathering a massive sphere of destruction: **Multi-Discordance**.

The two beams collided, warping the space around us. But there was no contest.

Ordinemon vanished in the explosion, its data scattered. I stood my ground, unmoved. Once again, I had proven that I am the **Dragon King**.

I returned to headquarters, endured the empty praise of cowards, and maintained my stoic persona. I had an appointment.

I went to see Xiao Wang. She had finally spotted me.

"Master!" She lunged at me, coiling her massive dragon body around mine. Her swords scraped against my armor. I put a hand on her head and pushed her back.

"Scrape my armor again and I'll skin you."

"Don't be so mean! I missed you!"

"Is that why you ran away without a word?"

"I didn't want to be a burden!"

"You think I see you as a burden?"

"You don't, but others might... I don't want to drag you down."

I sighed. I had no counter for her logic. She’d just act cute or pout.

"Anyone visit lately?" I asked.

"Yeah. Some **BlackWarGreymon**."

Rare breed. I thought for a second. Ah, the "Owl" kid I beat back then.

"What did he want?"

"He blew up a bunch of 'Pervert Party' creeps. He asked for directions, and I pointed him toward the forest."

Just another hero playing knight. Typical for this world.

"Take care of yourself," I told her. "Eat three meals a day. Understand? Three."

"Yes, Master!"

"Wipe that grin off your face." I knocked her on the head, the metal ringing for a long time.

"Does your hand hurt?" she asked.

"No. Why would it?"

"Because my body is hard."

"Shut up. Keep your blades sharp. Your left one is getting rusty. Don't embarrass me."

"Understood, Master!"

I sent her off to catch fish. Now, it was time for the uninvited guest.

"The show's over," I said to the shadows. "You coming out, or do I have to drag you?"

**Zero** emerged, laughing softly. "When did you notice?"

"Since you started following me. Why the interest? Looking for a fight? Or just a thrill? It’s all the same to me. Some people just need a lesson. Right, **Jesmon**?"

Zero smiled. He said he wasn't on a mission; it was his own choice. I didn't believe him. A tool doesn't have choices.

"Good job on the mission, Dragon."

"Save the fake praise," I spat. "I know about your hacks. You’re not that clever. You, and that Jesmon form of yours."

Zero’s Jesmon had been modified by US intelligence—a lone wolf that could shift its data volume at will. A shameless cheat.

"Since you know that... perhaps your days are numbered."

"Try me," I grinned. "I'm always ready."

The tension was electric. He didn't back down. He was a true fighter, at least.

"Another time," he said, merging back into the shadows. "And a word of advice: don't get too curious. For your sake. And hers."

"Thanks for the tip," I said, my voice cold. "But if anything happens to her, you're the first one I’m coming for."

"We'll see."

The bastard left. I looked back at Xiao Wang’s cave. My chest felt tight.

"Xiao Wang! Come here!"

"What is it, Master?"

"We're leaving. I’m finding you a new place."

"Where?"

"You'll see."
