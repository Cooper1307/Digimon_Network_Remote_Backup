# Chapter 8: Mother's Testament

The battle with the Demon Lord of "Sloth," Belphemon, continued.

Crane's sudden assault proved effective; Belphemon was caught off guard, pinned to the ground and clutching half its face as it let out a howl of agony toward the sky. Seizing this window, Crane used **Dark Despair** again, severing the chains the Demon Lord had plunged into the ground, cutting off its energy supply. Without replenishment, it could not recover, and the Demon Lord's body could no longer withstand high-intensity damage. Facing the combined assault of the group once more, it became vulnerable and was quickly buried in the smoke of the explosions.

"Sakura, cover me!"

"Coming!"

Belphemon's massive shadow gradually emerged from the smoke. Sensing the opportunity was near, Crane and I exchanged a look, understanding each other's intent. I grabbed Crane's hand and was carried into the sky, then thrown forward. Using that momentum, I thrust the **Rose Rapier** head-on into the resurrected Demon Lord, successfully drawing all its attention.

Its face heavily damaged, Belphemon fell into a true rage, completely losing control. Before it could make a major move, I used **Thorn Whipping** to entwine its neck, restricting its actions, and told Crane in the sky, "It's all yours!"

"No need to tell me."

Crane spread her arms and controlled both hands, releasing her ultimate technique—**Chaos Degradation**. The "Angelic" right side gathered pale blue "Light" energy, while the "Demonic" left side gathered pale red "Dark" energy. Both were released at Belphemon simultaneously, merging to create a brilliant gateway. Immense energy erupted from it, and together with the surrounding environment, Belphemon was sucked inside, banished to the far side of a different dimension.

Jumping off the side of the Demon Lord's body, Crane grabbed my hand once more, catching me and carrying me away from the ripple effects of the dimensional gate. We soared through the sky in a brief moment of solitude.

"You 'Supported' very well."

She suddenly threw this line at me out of the blue, making my heart flutter a bit, though I suspected she might be speaking against her conscience.

"Feeling a bit reluctant?" I pouted and turned my face away, feeling somewhat petty. Peering at her reaction, though she didn't show it clearly, I could vaguely detect a flicker of annoyance on her face—she was likely being petty just like me. This only proved that we were both immature women.

The mission was a complete success—a victory for the **Free Birds**.

We thanked Magnamon and Zudomon for their help, bid them farewell, and then exchanged a few words with Mr. Heath, reflecting on the difficulty of the battle. Then, the group returned to the **Nature Court** to report.

This time, Chairman Flower was personally waiting at the entrance to welcome our triumphant return. Beside her, flanked by Lilimon and Piccolomon, was someone else—a human woman with exceptional proportions. She was very elegant, with an undeniable aura, looking perhaps slightly older than me. She wore a police uniform, appearing upright and charming.

Skipping past Chairman Flower's long-winded introduction, I'll get straight to the point: she was "Snake."

"Hinomoto Snake, nice to meet you."

I stepped forward to greet her, as she was the person I had been looking for. "Nice to meet you, Officer Hinomoto..."

"Ah, no need for such formalities," she replied with a sweet smile. "I'm not a police officer; I'm a fashion model. The Chairman said someone was looking for me urgently, so I came in during a break in a photoshoot and didn't have time to change. Please forgive any inconvenience."

The handover of the mission was handled by Captain Owl; I trusted them to accurately convey the news to Chairman Flower. As for me, it was time to settle a score with the woman in front of me.

I asked her point-blank, "Do you recognize me?"

"You are..." She studied my appearance, thinking for a long time before stating, "You look very much like an old friend of mine."

"Is her name Shimizu Iwami?"

I mentioned my mother's name. Hearing it, she immediately rushed forward and grabbed my arms, asking excitedly, "Yes, that's her! How... how is she? What happened? Why are you here instead?"

I recounted everything to her, start to finish.

After listening to my account, she let out a long sigh and slumped onto the grass of the **Nature Court**. The light in her eyes faded, and her expression became heavy beyond words—she looked like she had aged fifty years in an instant.

"She sent you to find me?"

"Not exactly," I stated truthfully. "I just wanted to see for myself what kind of person she lost to."

"Is it as simple as that?"

"As simple as that."

"Heh, heh." She gave a weak laugh and said to me, "You win, Sakura Mandai."

She called out my name, even though I hadn't told her.

Sensing my surprise, she revealed the truth. It turned out my mother, Ms. Shimizu Iwami, had known for a long time that she might encounter misfortune. Thus, she had made her testament in advance, arranging things for later—including transferring her account to my name and arranging for Snake to be my personal mentor, to help me familiarize myself with this world quickly, inherit her stature within it, and live as freely as she did.

"How 'free' was she?"

"The two of us were the elite of the **Nature Court**. The '**Twin Flowers**' referred to us."

The moment she mentioned "Twin Flowers," I understood. It was one of the four most famous duos among the guild's elite, along with the **Holy Knights**' "Red and Blue," the **Raider Brigade**'s "Rainbow Starlight," and **Atlantis**'s "Amphibious Brothers," collectively known as the "Guild Quadrille." Their reputation was known throughout the entire Atrium system. I had previously come across an introduction to them in my mother's diary, but I never expected her to be one of the flowers.

"Wow, that's truly impressive," I complimented her insincerely. "So, she wanted you to be my mentor..."

What was this? Did she not trust her own daughter? Did she think I couldn't forge my own path? Or was she worried I'd be tricked in a strange world? I didn't think any of that was likely.

"If you're unwilling, I won't force you," she said in a negotiable tone. "She also told me that if we met for the first time and you were defiant, refusing to listen or trust me, I should go ahead and personally handle you—to let you experience that the cruelty of this world is no less than that of reality. Now, it seems that won't be necessary."

Of course not. Having defeated a Demon Lord, the **Free Birds** weren't about to be tied down by a snake. That said, Snake was still someone worth my trust, being an old acquaintance of my mother's; it wouldn't hurt to make a new friend.

I told her about my situation. After listening, she didn't seem surprised, but instead asked me, "So, have you found a way for you to return to reality yet?"

I shook my head, indicating we hadn't.

She didn't say much else, only expressing sympathy for my plight, and revealed to me, "Based on my deduction, Chairman Flower likely shares the same predicament as you, though she has her own concerns."

In other words, she didn't trust any "person," and even with her own servants, she remained guarded. This was likely why her garden was filled with Digimon.

"So, Chairman Flower has no friends?"

"Pretty much," Snake told me. "The closest relationship she has is with people like Heath. Other than that... there doesn't seem to be anyone else. She rarely initiates contact with others; it's always them coming to her."

"What was my mother's relationship like with the Chairman?"

"How should I put it..." Snake looked slightly troubled. "If I say it was good, it wasn't *that* good. If I say it was bad, they truly respected each other and showed each other a great deal of face. Oh, right, I forgot to tell you—the Chairman of the **Nature Court** is replaceable."

"Replaceable?"

It was the first I'd heard of it.

"Do you remember the agreement between me and your mother?"

"Of course," I said fluently. "Whoever evolved to Mega level first would be eligible to run for the next Chairman... Speaking of which, after so much time in the digital world, it's a bit strange that you haven't become Chairman yet, isn't it?"

Her face immediately turned sour, as if I had struck a nerve.

"Ah, that... actually, it's not 'strange'," she said sheepishly. "I've had the eligibility and even challenged the Chairman... but I've just never won, have I?"

"That really is..."

"But it doesn't matter!" She suddenly changed her tone, looking at me with expectant eyes. "Now there's you! If it's you, I think you won't be like me—overestimating your own strength and getting thrashed by the Chairman."

No, no, no, she thought too highly of me. If I went, the result would be the same, and likely worse. If you think about it simply, if I had that kind of ability, I wouldn't be hanging around with Owl and the others. Besides, if I had that kind of strength, how could I have been bullied that way by a pervert from the start?

Seeing my feigned modesty, she smiled and told me I wasn't being frank. I admitted as much—not only was I not frank, I was also a bit arrogant, conceited, and proud. Who could blame me? I was young.

Being young is an asset; no arguments accepted.

"How about we give it a try?" she suggested. "You and me, right here. Just a friendly match, what do you say?"

"A try it is."

Though Sakura Mandai wasn't an expert fighter, she wasn't one to back down from a challenge.

In this informal duel, there was no need for pre-battle chatter. Once we switched to our Digimon forms, we went straight to it. She was **Lotusmon**, I was **Rosemon**; one purple, one red. The result: one won, one lost. No need to guess—I was definitely the loser, without a doubt.

Through that brief clash, I discovered her strength was anything but ordinary. It was no exaggeration to say that within the **Free Birds**, aside from Owl, no one else was her match. Both in combat experience and nimble response, she far surpassed us. She truly deserved her place as the strongest in the guild, second only to the Chairman.

"You... you're incredible..."

I clutching my waist as she pulled me up from the ground, my face looking bitter as I asked for confirmation: "Did my mother... did she have this level of strength too?"

"You want my honest opinion?"

"Of course."

"She was stronger than me."

I suddenly felt a pang in my chest, a feeling I couldn't quite name.

"I hate to admit it, but it's the truth. She was better at solo combat, and in terms of physical stamina, she was far ahead of me. If she were still alive, the position of Chairman would be hers."

Coincidentally, I felt the same way.

Since she had admitted it herself, there was no need for me to dwell on it. Having completed the purpose of my visit, it was time to leave—yet I couldn't return, which was a kind of tragedy in itself.

Owl and the others rushed over after hearing the commotion. Seeing us safe and sound, having made peace and sitting together like sisters, they finally breathed a sigh of relief.

"You two... did you have to make such a scene..."

While Owl was walking over, Snake leaned into my ear and asked, "Is he your boyfriend?"

I denied her guess with absolute certainty: "No, he's my savior. He promised to help me find a way back to reality. I'm one of them now."

"Not bad. Taking down Belphemon right after joining—you have potential."

"Hardly. I'm still far behind you."

We smiled at each other, and then she said, "Young people shouldn't be so polite; it'll go to this senior's head! Hmm? Speaking of which, there was a request for me to serve as a bodyguard for a **Pukumon** and assist it in crossing the sea. I couldn't find where it was, so I've been putting it off..."

I felt this was purely an excuse, likely made up on the spot without a draft. To put it bluntly, she was using her senior status to dump the tasks from above onto us, calling it "mentorship" or "help." We were all women; who was she trying to fool?

"Speaking of which, Sakura, could you guys check it out for me?"

What did I say? As expected, more made-up reasons followed.

"I don't want them to have a bad impression of our **Nature Court** because of my personal reasons. I've already cleared it with the Chairman. Just think of it as a favor to your senior, okay?"

I wasn't the one to make that call; ask our Captain, he was right in front of you.

"Okay?"

I repeated it to Owl. He was stunned for a moment, then tilted his head and said to me, "Are you... being that... rash? Not even going to... discuss it with the team...?"

He was right; I was a member of the **Free Birds**, and I should prioritize the team's interests.

So I flatly refused her: "Senior Snake, as you can see, our Captain... and everyone else, seem quite reluctant. Besides, compared to yours, our strength is like children playing house. Could you perhaps find someone more capable?"

Normally, a senior who was thick-skinned enough to hear such a rejection would have backed off and withdrawn their unreasonable request. Snake did exactly that, leaving me with plenty of face—but another senior on the other side didn't seem to feel the same way.

"Don't go looking for anyone else."

Owl interrupted me just in time, stepping forward and whispering into my ear, "It's not every day a job walks in the door. Opportunities are for seizing; everything can be discussed."

With that, he turned back to Snake and began to persuade her: "Truly, wait for us a moment while we discuss our plans internally. We'll see if everyone has enough free time. If it's all good, it's no problem—the **Free Birds** are happy to serve you."

So this was what he meant by "discussing"? I have to say, Owl, I'm looking at you in a new light again.

As I said, he's the Captain, so he makes the calls; my opinion was just my own. I, of course, had no problem—I was always free. So while they were discussing, I asked Snake, "Senior, I just heard you mention crossing the sea... where are you going?"

"The aquatic guild, **Atlantis**."

"Is it for something special?"

"Not particularly," she said. "It's just a **Pukumon** who wants to go there to propose to someone. I don't know what he did before, but he's very unpopular there—they're ready to draw blades at a moment's notice. I felt sorry for him, so I took the request."

She truly was a kind person, completely unlike what her name suggested.

"Is it dangerous?"

"Depends on who you ask," Snake explained. "Pukumon is a Virus-type, and he's most afraid of the 'Vaccines' in the water making trouble and ruining his chances. This senior is only one person and can't swim, so my heart is willing but my strength is lacking."

I'd had enough of her excuses—it was beyond reason. At the same time, I found it hard to understand what benefit she got from being so transparently petty and calculating. I only hoped this wouldn't be another life-risking mission, or the **Free Birds** would have to risk it all again to fly free and find the meaning of survival.
