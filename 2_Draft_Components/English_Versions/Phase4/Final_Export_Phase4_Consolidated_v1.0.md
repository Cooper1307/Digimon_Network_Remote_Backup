## Chapter 6: The Chairman's Request

The Atrium is divided into a total of ten regions, each managed by its respective Digimon Guild.

Among them, the **Holy Knights**, **Iron Soldiers**, **Atlantis**, and **Underworld Club** occupy the outer layers. The remaining guilds are enclosed within these, with the core area being the **The 'Drink' Bar** and the adjacent public grand garden connected to several regions—the **Nature Court**.

This is the paradise of plants, the kingdom of fairies. Just standing at the edge of the region, one can feel the rich oxygen content within; it is so fresh and so soul-refreshing. Similar to "The 'Drink' Bar," anyone can enter here, but recently it has been undergoing "internal maintenance," and all non-guild members are prohibited from entering. There are even temporary sentry posts set up at the entrance, manned by several differently colored **Piccolomon**.

"Halt! Who goes there!?"

"Honored guests of your Chairman."

Owl explained our purpose on our behalf. One Piccolomon went inside to relay the message. Soon after, the **Lilimon** who came out with it received us and led us into this massive "data" garden.

"It seems even our **Free Birds** aren't known by everyone, huh?"

At these words, Dove couldn't help but chuckle. Falcon walked ahead, baring his teeth in a grin but offering no comment. Owl looked a bit embarrassed and quickly explained to me, "They are all the Chairman's servants, not players—genuine Digimon. You can't expect them to recognize you naturally."

Fine, I believed him. Or at least, I'd pretend I did.

The Chairman here goes by the name **Flower**, a 27-year-old from Singapore. She’s quite special; she never shows her true face in the Atrium system and always appears as **BanchoLilimon**. It’s said this is because she lacks confidence in her appearance—who knows if that’s true? In a garden draped with sprawling blooms, she had prepared floral tea, awaiting our arrival. Another person sat beside her—the one she had specifically notified.

"You didn't say you'd called someone else."

As usual, Owl went straight to the point, not mincing words with them.

From their conversation, I gathered they all knew each other, and their relationship seemed quite good, devoid of any stiff formalities. They spoke openly, laughing and joking. In fact, not just Owl, but Dove and Falcon also knew who the other person was.

"Mr. Heath is the President of the **Birdramon Commune**," Dove proactively introduced him to me. "A man with incredible social skills, naturally friendly, with friends all over the place. There's almost no one he doesn't get along with."

"You guys too?" I asked.

"Of course," Dove replied. "He's my savior. When I first entered the Atrium as a **Terriermon**, I loved wandering around the Digital World. Once, I accidentally fell off a cliff, unable to move, and was surrounded by a bunch of **Togemon** with no eyes on their backs—almost got pricked to death. He happened to be flying by, heard my cries for help, and descended from the sky with a flock of **Birdramon** to rescue me."

His words were filled with respect for Mr. Heath, which left me quite touched.

To this day, Dove is deeply grateful for Mr. Heath's rescue. Even though he's not yet of drinking age, he still frequently runs over to Chairman Adam's place to treat Mr. Heath to a drink after a long day of patrolling, just to help him relax.

"Yo, little Dove, long time no see! You've been well?"

"You too, Mr. Heath," Dove smiled. "By the way, why are you here?"

"Chairman Flower invited two groups: yours and mine. The other little birds are circling in the sky; you can see them if you look up... well, they're flying a bit high, doesn't matter."

Simply put, he was here to help us.

"What is so important that you need two groups?" Owl voiced this question on our behalf.

Chairman Flower looked slightly troubled, appearing exhausted as she acted coy with the two men. The conversation that followed was quite explicit, completely mismatched with her cute face. Dove and I flushed red, not daring to listen too closely, while only Falcon appeared excited, thoroughly enjoying it.

Suddenly, he interrupted Chairman Flower, "Wait a second, it appeared in your bedroom? Don't tell me it wants to sleep... uh, no, it wants to share a bed with you?"

"That's not it," the Chairman shook her head. "It simply appeared... just like that, suddenly. You understand, right? One moment it wasn't there, the next it was."

The "it" they were referring to was the key target—or rather, the object—of this mission: **Belphemon: Sleep Mode**. It had mysteriously appeared in the Chairman's room, startling her into summoning the fairies in the garden and the guild members nearby. Together, after exhausting every possible method and using every ounce of strength, they finally managed to move it from her room to the garden.

"So, you want us to help you transport this lethal thing back to the Digital World and then eliminate it?"

"Exactly! Mr. Heath, you understand me so well..."

"Hardly." Mr. Heath sighed and turned his head toward Owl. "What do you say? You're already here. Care to lend a hand to a beautiful lady?"

Owl didn't answer immediately. Instead, he asked, "Do you have any idea how difficult this thing is to handle?"

"Of course," Mr. Heath said easily. "At least, I'm no match for it. Our **Birdramon Commune** can only help you transport it out. Whether it can be dealt with is up to you Mega-levels."

Hearing this, I couldn't help but interject, asking Chairman Flower, "Why didn't you call more people? They... don't seem very willing."

"None of them were willing, and I couldn't count on anyone else."

As she spoke, Flower scanned my body from head to toe, a satisfied smile appearing on her face. Then, before I could notice, she reached out and grabbed my waist, lunging into my chest. She buried her face in my bosom, rubbing against me while tearfully recounting her plight, "Waaah! I... I am a Chairman after all, and I asked so many people, but only you guys were willing to help me. I'm so moved, waaah, really moved... I wonder if you can help me..."

"That depends on whether our Captain agrees."

"Persuade him for me! Please! Please—"

"I..."

I really couldn't stand her. This woman dared to openly grope me under this pretext, right in broad daylight. From my lower back all the way down to my rear, I was nearly rubbed to a sheen, and she still wouldn't let go, instead squeezing tighter and with more force. No matter how I struggled, she remained unmoved, clearly intending to take advantage of me from the start.

I have to admit, the **Nature Court** is truly "natural"—everything is so natural, so blatant. It was one thing for her to take liberties, but Falcon was benefiting too; he stared directly at us, not helping me at all, but watched with fascination as if he were learning techniques. Meanwhile, he kept providing cover for the Chairman, chiming in with supportive words so the others wouldn't pay attention to us. They were truly a pair made in heaven; it would be a pity if they didn't end up together.

"Owl, just agree," I suggested. "Looking at how pitiful the Chairman is, let's just help her."

As I spoke, Flower was continuing her exploration down my thighs. I grabbed her hand and forcefully pulled it away, then, with a hint of a sinister smile, I curved my knuckles and poked hard into her exposed navel. Coldly, I told her, "You'd better restrain yourself. That way, none of us lose face."

In other words, I was showing her: *This sister isn't a pushover!*

She slowly raised a hand in agreement. Since things were as they were, I didn't want to torment her further—I'd just assume she was jealous earlier. At most, I'd let her take advantage once; it's not my actual body anyway.

After some deliberation, Owl and Mr. Heath's opinions aligned: they decided to help.

"Th-thank you..."

Flower was clutching her stomach, her face looking none too good. Mr. Heath noticed and was quite puzzled, "What is with you? What happened? Did you eat something bad?"

She could only nod helplessly.

"Then it's settled."

Owl shifted the topic, turning his eyes toward Chairman Flower and bringing up another matter, "Is there a person named '**Snake**' here? Our newcomer is looking for her. If you can contact her, please make it convenient for us."

"Deal."

Flower raised a hand in an "OK" gesture. "The Lilimon who led you in will take you over. I'll contact Snake and ensure you meet her when you return."

Owl's move was executed flawlessly; I have to look at him in a new light now.

The sleeping Belphemon looked like a massive plush doll—black and round, with a pair of horns on its head and something resembling either ears or wings behind its head. It appeared unusually cute. Even so, it was not to be trifled with; just a single yawn could release a powerful shockwave.

According to the Lilimon, at first, Chairman Flower wanted to use her kick technique, **Petal Dance**, to move it out of the room, but she was met with its retaliation. Black flames, **Hinokagutsuchi**, were released from the chains wrapped around its body, not only burning half of the Chairman's calf but also incinerating several flower breeding rooms in a row. With a series of flower embryos destroyed, the Chairman, in a fit of rage, unleashed her ultimate technique, **Absolute Field**, swinging her yo-yo to slice through space, and used this spatial tunnel as a path to finally transfer it to the garden through a combined effort.

"You guys really didn't have it easy."

If it weren't for "it," the **Nature Court** wouldn't be having any "internal maintenance." These were all excuses made up on the spot to prevent any panic in the outside world.

"Why?" I was quite puzzled. "Isn't it usually better to spread the news as widely as possible so more people come to help?"

"That is Belphemon."

"So?"

"You're a Mega, so you aren't afraid. We're different," the Lilimon told me. "Take me for example; I am just a fairy-type Data-attribute. Meeting a Demon Lord-type Virus-attribute like Belphemon means only death."

I understood.

In other words, the reason everyone didn't come to help was simply because they were afraid of losing their lives. Thinking about it now, I might have been a bit impulsive just then. Owl and Mr. Heath too—they could have refused my suggestion or even ignored me altogether.

"Sigh, this is a tough battle," Falcon couldn't help but sigh. "Eliminating it isn't hard; everyone just needs to use their ultimates together to hit it. The problem is how to ensure it doesn't switch into **Rage Mode** after that."

"Is there a difference?"

"A huge one," Falcon slapped his face to steel himself and told me. "In Sleep Mode, it won't actively attack as long as we aren't too rough with it. But if it switches to Rage Mode... let's just say, at that point, you'll have to pray for yourself. Even my speed might not be enough to save you in time. Any Digimon that hasn't reached the Ultimate (Perfect) level will die instantly from data decomposition if hit by its roar; even Megas will be severely wounded, and some might even die."

His description was very grave, and Owl listened without offering any rebuttal. It showed that at least during this time, Falcon was no longer the man whose head was filled with perverted thoughts; he was also considering the team's future, trying to find a way to save as many as possible.

I walked to Owl's side, staring at the massive Demon Lord suspended in mid-air. I asked him, "What do you say, Captain? Are you confident in this 'Exploration'?"

I wasn't wrong; a **Direct Exploration** is also an exploration.

"Not at all," Owl shook his head and asked me, "Is it too late to regret now?"

"It's not," I stated seriously. "As long as you can swallow your pride and tell Chairman Flower to her face that you're afraid of death and so are we—we'd follow you away quite willingly."

He gave me a bitter smile, then reached out and patted my shoulder as he passed by me, while also reminding me, "Don't be careless. The opponent is strong. I'll leave the **Support** to you, Sakura. Don't die before we do."

That wasn't up to me; it was in the hands of fate.

Mr. Heath had already switched to his **Garudamon** form and flown into the sky to rendezvous with his commune members; they were about to begin the transport mission for the sleeping Belphemon. The specific method was to use a temporary fire-wall composed of thousands of **Birdramon** to push it bit by bit toward the outer perimeter of the **Nature Court**, and then it would be completely sent out by a second group of members waiting at the Atrium Square. During this process, it would be best if anyone were willing to lend a hand; if not, they could only sacrifice a portion of the Birdramon as a price to transfer such a massive security hazard, preventing more people from losing their lives in vain.

## Chapter 7: The Resurrected Demon King

The transport operation continued, and everyone's nerves were taut, fearing a single slip-up in any part of the process.

"About to exit the **Nature Court** domain! Group two, get ready!"

Mr. Heath circled above the transported object, monitoring the overall situation from multiple angles. For now, everything was running smoothly, with no major issues—a stroke of luck amidst the misfortune.

The same was true for the **Free Birds**. I followed behind, keeping an eye on the suspended Belphemon while also observing the crowds below. Almost everyone had the same reaction—stopping to watch. Many likely didn't know what it was, much less what we were doing, treating it as some kind of parade. Those with a bit of knowledge quickly pulled their companions away, providing a lecture on exactly how dangerous this thing was.

"The Sin of Sloth, Belphemon."

This was a new term I heard. Where these Demon Lord-type Digimon came from, we didn't know; we only knew they were by no means roles that humans could easily play, and unless by chance, they were never easily encountered.

"Strange, isn't it?" Owl suddenly leaned in and said to me. "One of the **Seven Great Demon Lords**, Sloth itself, has descended upon the Atrium and hasn't been treated by the system as a BUG. This suggests that beneath that skin, there is likely a person just like us. Whether they are trapped inside waiting for rescue or biding their time to cause havoc once they wake up, no one can say for sure."

If that were true, then this matter was indeed suspicious.

"Could it be someone wanting to take revenge on Chairman Flower?"

"Who knows." Owl gave a cold laugh. "It's normal for someone who refuses to show their real face to be targeted. Then again, whoever wanted to retaliate against her is certainly capable..."

No kidding. To be able to quietly drop Belphemon into the Chairman's private room without leaving a trace—I couldn't think of any identity other than a network hacker. Stirring up trouble in reality and seeking revenge online—this kind of tactic was all too common in this day and age.

With the preamble finished, we quickly cut to the chase:

Once the transport team left the territory of the **Nature Court**, Belphemon suddenly stopped moving. It hung in the air as if caught in a BUG, remaining unmoved no matter how the Birdramon fire-wall pushed from behind.

"What's going on!?"

Everyone panicked, fearing it would switch forms at any second.

"Everyone stop, back away!" Mr. Heath immediately made deployments. "Transport group, standby on the spot! Maintain distance! **Free Birds**, clear the area, evacuate everyone nearby, quick!"

As the changes were carried out in an orderly fashion, Owl stepped forward on our behalf to inquire about the situation.

"Are there any changes?"

"None for now," Mr. Heath replied. "But there likely will be soon. We can't let our guard down."

"Do you need me to call in the analysis team?"

"You know them?" Mr. Heath looked puzzled. "Is that something only the official **Investigation Team** has access to... you kid, don't tell me—"

"Yes," Owl admitted. "Who says the **Free Birds** aren't official? As part of the **Investigation Team**, we eat from the same bowl and belong to the same department. There's no distinction between 'official' and 'civilian'."

Mr. Heath could only resign himself. "Fine, bring them in. But make sure they stay safe."

"Don't worry."

With that, Owl turned his head slightly and gestured to Heath. "They're here."

"So fast!?"

"Just in case something went wrong during transport, I had them on standby nearby." Owl cracked his neck. "It's rare they get to be useful. Just stay aside and watch."

The so-called analysis team was a squad composed of Armor-level Digimon, all belonging to the **Armor Rebirth** club—a subordinate department of the **Investigation Team**. Members came from all over the world and were generally experts in data analysis.

The team leader, **Magnamon**, led the way toward Belphemon. He first circled the target, confirming its appearance hadn't changed, then beckoned the five members behind him: **Halsemon**, **Shadramon**, **Quetzalmon**, **Flybeemon**, and **Togemogumon**. The six of them positioned themselves around Belphemon—front, back, left, right, top, and bottom—simultaneously using their Digimentals to perform a comprehensive analysis.

The process lasted a long time, and everyone broke into a cold sweat for them.

When the analysis concluded, Magnamon approached Owl and Mr. Heath to report some bad news: "The data supply within Belphemon is insufficient. Unless someone sacrifices themselves to provide the nutrients it needs to move, no amount of **Birdramon** will ever make it budge."

Owl and Mr. Heath looked at each other and said simultaneously, "Then why was it possible before?"

"Because the space within the **Nature Court** domain is saturated with data." Fearing the two still didn't understand, Magnamon explained in layman's terms: "Think of it this way: the trees, the flowers, and the grass there—they are all made of data. Since they are data, the oxygen they release is also data. A portion of the energy from the **Birdramon** combined with the air provided the conditions for Belphemon to move."

He explained it quite clearly—so clearly that it left the two in front of him confused.

Owl asked Heath, "Did you understand?"

Heath nodded. "Mostly. You?"

"Same."

Then Mr. Heath asked Magnamon, "So, in this situation, how can we make it move forward just a bit more without sacrificing our own people?"

Owl chimed in, saying, "As you can see, we're inches away from the fire-wall, with only the Atrium Square in between. You can't just leave everyone who recently logged in facing a constant threat of death."

Magnamon listened and nodded silently, finding their words reasonable. After some careful thought and deduction, he finally proposed an extremely dangerous but effective method: "Find a way to wake it up, then draw its attention so it keeps chasing you, until you lead it into the Digital World."

"Be serious now," Mr. Heath's facial muscles twitched as he said, "How is that any different from suicide? Who would be tired enough of living to play like that?"

"It's not impossible."

Owl's words nearly made Mr. Heath's jaw drop. "No way! Are you crazy? If you want to die, you don't need to do it like this. What's the deal with taking others with you—scared of being lonely on the road to the underworld?"

"Unless you have a better idea?"

His counter-question immediately shut Mr. Heath's mouth.

Afterward, Owl told us about this risky plan and asked if we were willing to try it with him. Falcon and Dove naturally had no problem; they had walked with Owl for a long time and had done all sorts of life-and-death tasks for him. The situation primarily came down to me.

"Sakura, you decide."

"Ah... me? You're serious?"

"Don't forget the other role of the **Support**: helping the team make judgments."

He said it as if it were true. Where was this earlier? Shifting the blame to me at the critical moment—if that wasn't bullying a newcomer, I didn't know what was.

"Fine, I'll accompany you all to the bitter end."

I was forced to say these words, a mix of helplessness, regret, and a tiny bit of motivation—completely lacking in momentum. I felt like a lamb led to the slaughter, weak and pitiful, yet forced to mobilize everyone toward the knife.

"Aaaarrgh! I can't take it! Truly, I give in to you!" Mr. Heath was a bit frantic. "Risking my life with gentlemen! Since we're here, we might as well do something. Tell me, how do you plan to do it?"

"It's simple: just blast it."

With that, Owl swept his hand down. Dove immediately stepped forward, puffed out his chest, aimed at the sleeping Belphemon, and fired two **Giant Missiles** from his shoulders while activating all his cannons, launching a full-scale assault on Belphemon.

"It's no use, Captain!" Dove shouted back at Owl. "It needs more heat!"

"I'll go!"

"Get back here!"

Owl quickly stopped Falcon, who was about to rush in to help, and blocked him. He sent a massive **Dark Gaia Force** toward Belphemon. The resulting explosion was so immense that no one present could maintain their balance; those who could fly scattered, and those who couldn't fell to the ground. Before anyone could readjust, the sleeping Demon Lord had already awakened, brushing aside the smoke from the blast to reveal its other side—**Belphemon: Rage Mode**.

"I think we made it mad," Falcon said to me casually, drawing the large blade from his shoulder. The next second, he was bumped aside by Owl as Belphemon's claws came down, the resulting dust storm sweeping over us once again.

"—**Gold Solar Storm**!"

A brilliant golden laser cleared the crisis of our blocked vision; it was a gift from Magnamon.

"Quick! Drag it out before it reacts!"

"Understood!" Falcon was the first to respond. As a fellow golden comrade, his competitiveness was piqued—no matter what, he couldn't let them look down on him. A Mega had to be more useful than an Armor-level!

"Daring to sneak attack me? Let me see how much skill you really have!"

As Falcon spoke, he swung his **Yellow Beast Crescent Blade** in the air. Combined with the two sharp blades protruding from his shoulders, he unleashed his finishing move, **Wolf-Beast Whirlwind**, delivering eternal pain to the newly awakened Belphemon.

The Demon Lord let out a howl of agony. Mr. Heath took the initiative, using **Shadow Wing** to deliver another shock. Magnamon wasn't to be outdone either, his whole body releasing the **Extreme Jihad**. Golden light and crimson flames intertwined, and with the help of my **Rose Rapier**, we successfully forced the Demon Lord back.

"Don't stop—"

Owl's voice pierced the sky. By the time it reached our ears, Belphemon had already swung its claws, wreathed in hellfire, delivering its **Dark Gift**. At the critical moment, a unique sound came from behind us:

"—**Hammer Boomerang**!"

Turning to look, a **Zudomon** had appeared out of nowhere. Aiming at Belphemon's head, he threw his **Thor's Hammer**, knocking him to the ground.

"Seeing injustice on the road, I draw my blade to help!" He offered an explanation for his arrival and actions.

With such a brave warrior coming to help, how could we have any complaints? We all thanked him in our hearts. Once the hammer returned to his hand, he didn't stop. Holding the hammer with both hands, he swept it across the ground, creating sparks and lightning as he aimed for the chin of the rising Belphemon, swinging the heavy hammer upward.

"—**Hammer Spark**!"

The powerful force lifted Belphemon off its feet. Under the combined action of Garudamon's charge and Owl's **Black Warrior Tornado**, the awakened "Sloth" Demon Lord completely passed through that fire-wall, breaking free from the Atrium system and arriving in the Digital World.

"Let's finish it in one go!"

At Owl's command, no one held back their ultimate moves, each using their final techniques to strike Belphemon.

Falcon and Dove were on the outer perimeter, their **Twin Moon Crescent Slash** and **Burst Shot** continuously battering the Demon Lord's body, keeping it disoriented and unable to focus on other directions. Meanwhile, **Shadow Wing** and **Forbidden Temptation**—the double crimson strike—combined with the blinding light from **Plasma Shot** and **Hammer Spark** to strike Belphemon's chest. The resurrected Demon Lord was in agony, flailing its limbs to try and stop us from dealing more pain. Before it could draw the chains from its body to release the black flames of **Hinokagutsuchi**, Owl quickly gathered a **Dark Gaia Force** formed from "negative thoughts" and completely ended it within the raging fires of the explosion.

"Whew, finally over."

"Not yet!"

Owl's words alerted everyone, causing us to snap back from our relaxed state to high alert.

Peering through the gradually dissipating smoke, that massive figure was still visible. It stood firm, without a hint of wavering, its chains already plunged into the ground, absorbing nutrients from the earth.

"It... it's getting bigger..."

Dove's shocked expression represented most of those present. No one had expected this Demon Lord to be so resilient; so many ultimate moves had been combined, yet they had seemingly achieved nothing.

Falcon also joined us to discuss a strategy: "Big brother, what now?"

"Find a way not to get hurt first—"

Owl finished speaking and knocked Falcon out of the way, taking the Demon Lord's incoming chain head-on and flying back like a pinball, crashing into the nearby forest. I too had no time to react, watching as the Demon Lord's chain reached my face. In the crisis, Mr. Heath grabbed the chain with his talons, intending to pull it up, but the chain immediately became like a snake, wrapping around his ankle.

"Mr. Heath—"

"Don't worry about me, get out of here!"

Next, he was dragged back by the Demon Lord using the chain and used as a flail. After being swung in a large circle in the sky, he was slammed directly onto Zudomon's body. Before he could catch his breath, he was snatched back again, taking a heavy punch from the Demon Lord and bouncing back onto Zudomon once more.

Looking elsewhere, Dove had also been tragically ensnared by the chains. Falcon was busy trying to sever them with his blade to rescue him, but after several attempts, he hadn't succeeded, unable to stop a curse from escaping his lips: "Damn it! Why is it so hard!?"

A flash of light suddenly erupted overhead. Looking up, Magnamon had tragically become Belphemon's target, with dozens of chains firmly binding him, making it difficult to release his **Extreme Jihad** to strike back. Black flames raced along the chains toward him, and soon, he disappeared into the explosion once again.

The word "total defeat" echoed in my mind for a long time, preventing me from moving my body as I should. I just stood there, staring—like a puppet or a brainless waste, helpless and powerless.

"Did we... just lose like this?" I couldn't help but ask myself.

Incinerated flower petals fell onto the back of my hand, bringing a slight sting that reminded me I hadn't turned into data yet—I was still alive. The roar of explosions overlapped; my legs felt weak as I slumped to the ground, taking a long breath as I prepared to accept fate's judgment.

"It's not over yet—"

A fierce battle cry came from behind, like someone had slapped me awake. Looking back, a black-and-white angel emerged from the fire-wall, descending like a crane, bringing a glimmer of hope to the battlefield. With her swift speed, she fired an arrow of light, **Holy Hope**, from her right arm, hitting the Demon Lord's head. Then, using her left hand, she used **Dark Despair** to forcefully break off one of the horns atop the Demon Lord's head, turning the tide for us.

"Is the **Support** only at this level!?" she yelled at me fiercely. "Is this the 'strength' you boast of? It's enough to make one's sides split with laughter!"

The provocation worked perfectly, successfully awakening my fighting spirit.

"And what of it!?" I shouted back at her, refusing to back down. "You, a **Substitute**, only show up now? Were you waiting for me, the **Support**, to handle this alone? You bastard!"

The others likely didn't know what we were doing, but it didn't matter. Women's friendships can sometimes be expressed in strange ways; after all, we were both stubborn people who couldn't stand appearing weak in front of someone we disliked.

"Let's go together, Sakura!"

"Hah! Keep your eyes peeled, Crane!"

## Chapter 8: Mother's Testament

The battle with the Demon Lord of "Sloth," Belphemon, continued.

Crane's sudden assault proved effective; Belphemon was caught off guard, pinned to the ground and clutching half its face as it let out a howl of agony toward the sky. Seizing this window, Crane used **Dark Despair** again, severing the chains the Demon Lord had plunged into the ground, cutting off its energy supply. Without replenishment, it could not recover, and the Demon Lord's body could no longer withstand high-intensity damage. Facing the combined assault of the group once more, it became vulnerable and was quickly buried in the smoke of the explosions.

"Sakura, cover me!"

"Coming!"

Belphemon's massive shadow gradually emerged from the smoke. Sensing the opportunity was near, Crane and I exchanged a look, understanding each other's intent. I grabbed Crane's hand and was carried into the sky, then thrown forward. Using that momentum, I thrust the **Rose Rapier** head-on into the resurrected Demon Lord, successfully drawing all its attention.

Its face heavily damaged, Belphemon fell into a true rage, completely losing control. Before it could make a major move, I used **Thorn Whipping** to entwine its neck, restricting its actions, and told Crane in the sky, "It's all yours!"

"No need to tell me."

Crane spread her arms and controlled both hands, releasing her ultimate technique—**Chaos Degradation**. The "Angelic" right side gathered pale blue "Light" energy, while the "Demonic" left side gathered pale red "Dark" energy. Both were released at Belphemon simultaneously, merging to create a brilliant gateway. Immense energy erupted from it, and together with the surrounding environment, Belphemon was sucked inside, banished to the far side of a different dimension.

Jumping off the side of the Demon Lord's body, Crane grabbed my hand once more, catching me and carrying me away from the ripple effects of the dimensional gate. We soared through the sky in a brief moment of solitude.

"You 'Supported' very well."

She suddenly threw this line at me out of the blue, making my heart flutter a bit, though I suspected she might be speaking against her conscience.

"Feeling a bit reluctant?" I pouted and turned my face away, feeling somewhat petty. Peering at her reaction, though she didn't show it clearly, I could vaguely detect a flicker of annoyance on her face—she was likely being petty just like me. This only proved that we were both immature women.

The mission was a complete success—a victory for the **Free Birds**.

We thanked Magnamon and Zudomon for their help, bid them farewell, and then exchanged a few words with Mr. Heath, reflecting on the difficulty of the battle. Then, the group returned to the **Nature Court** to report.

This time, Chairman Flower was personally waiting at the entrance to welcome our triumphant return. Beside her, flanked by Lilimon and Piccolomon, was someone else—a human woman with exceptional proportions. She was very elegant, with an undeniable aura, looking perhaps slightly older than me. She wore a police uniform, appearing upright and charming.

Skipping past Chairman Flower's long-winded introduction, I'll get straight to the point: she was "Snake."

"Hinomoto Snake, nice to meet you."

I stepped forward to greet her, as she was the person I had been looking for. "Nice to meet you, Officer Hinomoto..."

"Ah, no need for such formalities," she replied with a sweet smile. "I'm not a police officer; I'm a fashion model. The Chairman said someone was looking for me urgently, so I came in during a break in a photoshoot and didn't have time to change. Please forgive any inconvenience."

The handover of the mission was handled by Captain Owl; I trusted them to accurately convey the news to Chairman Flower. As for me, it was time to settle a score with the woman in front of me.

I asked her point-blank, "Do you recognize me?"

"You are..." She studied my appearance, thinking for a long time before stating, "You look very much like an old friend of mine."

"Is her name Shimizu Iwami?"

I mentioned my mother's name. Hearing it, she immediately rushed forward and grabbed my arms, asking excitedly, "Yes, that's her! How... how is she? What happened? Why are you here instead?"

I recounted everything to her, start to finish.

After listening to my account, she let out a long sigh and slumped onto the grass of the **Nature Court**. The light in her eyes faded, and her expression became heavy beyond words—she looked like she had aged fifty years in an instant.

"She sent you to find me?"

"Not exactly," I stated truthfully. "I just wanted to see for myself what kind of person she lost to."

"Is it as simple as that?"

"As simple as that."

"Heh, heh." She gave a weak laugh and said to me, "You win, Sakura Mandai."

She called out my name, even though I hadn't told her.

Sensing my surprise, she revealed the truth. It turned out my mother, Ms. Shimizu Iwami, had known for a long time that she might encounter misfortune. Thus, she had made her testament in advance, arranging things for later—including transferring her account to my name and arranging for Snake to be my personal mentor, to help me familiarize myself with this world quickly, inherit her stature within it, and live as freely as she did.

"How 'free' was she?"

"The two of us were the elite of the **Nature Court**. The '**Twin Flowers**' referred to us."

The moment she mentioned "Twin Flowers," I understood. It was one of the four most famous duos among the guild's elite, along with the **Holy Knights**' "Red and Blue," the **Raider Brigade**'s "Rainbow Starlight," and **Atlantis**'s "Amphibious Brothers," collectively known as the "Guild Quadrille." Their reputation was known throughout the entire Atrium system. I had previously come across an introduction to them in my mother's diary, but I never expected her to be one of the flowers.

"Wow, that's truly impressive," I complimented her insincerely. "So, she wanted you to be my mentor..."

What was this? Did she not trust her own daughter? Did she think I couldn't forge my own path? Or was she worried I'd be tricked in a strange world? I didn't think any of that was likely.

"If you're unwilling, I won't force you," she said in a negotiable tone. "She also told me that if we met for the first time and you were defiant, refusing to listen or trust me, I should go ahead and personally handle you—to let you experience that the cruelty of this world is no less than that of reality. Now, it seems that won't be necessary."

Of course not. Having defeated a Demon Lord, the **Free Birds** weren't about to be tied down by a snake. That said, Snake was still someone worth my trust, being an old acquaintance of my mother's; it wouldn't hurt to make a new friend.

I told her about my situation. After listening, she didn't seem surprised, but instead asked me, "So, have you found a way for you to return to reality yet?"

I shook my head, indicating we hadn't.

She didn't say much else, only expressing sympathy for my plight, and revealed to me, "Based on my deduction, Chairman Flower likely shares the same predicament as you, though she has her own concerns."

In other words, she didn't trust any "person," and even with her own servants, she remained guarded. This was likely why her garden was filled with Digimon.

"So, Chairman Flower has no friends?"

"Pretty much," Snake told me. "The closest relationship she has is with people like Heath. Other than that... there doesn't seem to be anyone else. She rarely initiates contact with others; it's always them coming to her."

"What was my mother's relationship like with the Chairman?"

"How should I put it..." Snake looked slightly troubled. "If I say it was good, it wasn't *that* good. If I say it was bad, they truly respected each other and showed each other a great deal of face. Oh, right, I forgot to tell you—the Chairman of the **Nature Court** is replaceable."

"Replaceable?"

It was the first I'd heard of it.

"Do you remember the agreement between me and your mother?"

"Of course," I said fluently. "Whoever evolved to Mega level first would be eligible to run for the next Chairman... Speaking of which, after so much time in the digital world, it's a bit strange that you haven't become Chairman yet, isn't it?"

Her face immediately turned sour, as if I had struck a nerve.

"Ah, that... actually, it's not 'strange',", she said sheepishly. "I've had the eligibility and even challenged the Chairman... but I've just never won, have I?"

"That really is..."

"But it doesn't matter!" She suddenly changed her tone, looking at me with expectant eyes. "Now there's you! If it's you, I think you won't be like me—overestimating your own strength and getting thrashed by the Chairman."

No, no, no, she thought too highly of me. If I went, the result would be the same, and likely worse. If you think about it simply, if I had that kind of ability, I wouldn't be hanging around with Owl and the others. Besides, if I had that kind of strength, how could I have been bullied that way by a pervert from the start?

Seeing my feigned modesty, she smiled and told me I wasn't being frank. I admitted as much—not only was I not frank, I was also a bit arrogant, conceited, and proud. Who could blame me? I was young.

Being young is an asset; no arguments accepted.

"How about we give it a try?" she suggested. "You and me, right here. Just a friendly match, what do you say?"

"A try it is."

Though Sakura Mandai wasn't an expert fighter, she wasn't one to back down from a challenge.

In this informal duel, there was no need for pre-battle chatter. Once we switched to our Digimon forms, we went straight to it. She was **Lotusmon**, I was **Rosemon**; one purple, one red. The result: one won, one lost. No need to guess—I was definitely the loser, without a doubt.

Through that brief clash, I discovered her strength was anything but ordinary. It was no exaggeration to say that within the **Free Birds**, aside from Owl, no one else was her match. Both in combat experience and nimble response, she far surpassed us. She truly deserved her place as the strongest in the guild, second only to the Chairman.

"You... you're incredible..."

I clutching my waist as she pulled me up from the ground, my face looking bitter as I asked for confirmation: "Did my mother... did she have this level of strength too?"

"You want my honest opinion?"

"Of course."

"She was stronger than me."

I suddenly felt a pang in my chest, a feeling I couldn't quite name.

"I hate to admit it, but it's the truth. She was better at solo combat, and in terms of physical stamina, she was far ahead of me. If she were still alive, the position of Chairman would be hers."

Coincidentally, I felt the same way.

Since she had admitted it herself, there was no need for me to dwell on it. Having completed the purpose of my visit, it was time to leave—yet I couldn't return, which was a kind of tragedy in itself.

Owl and the others rushed over after hearing the commotion. Seeing us safe and sound, having made peace and sitting together like sisters, they finally breathed a sigh of relief.

"You two... did you have to make such a scene..."

While Owl was walking over, Snake leaned into my ear and asked, "Is he your boyfriend?"

I denied her guess with absolute certainty: "No, he's my savior. He promised to help me find a way back to reality. I'm one of them now."

"Not bad. Taking down Belphemon right after joining—you have potential."

"Hardly. I'm still far behind you."

We smiled at each other, and then she said, "Young people shouldn't be so polite; it'll go to this senior's head! Hmm? Speaking of which, there was a request for me to serve as a bodyguard for a **Pukumon** and assist it in crossing the sea. I couldn't find where it was, so I've been putting it off..."

I felt this was purely an excuse, likely made up on the spot without a draft. To put it bluntly, she was using her senior status to dump the tasks from above onto us, calling it "mentorship" or "help." We were all women; who was she trying to fool?

"Speaking of which, Sakura, could you guys check it out for me?"

What did I say? As expected, more made-up reasons followed.

"I don't want them to have a bad impression of our **Nature Court** because of my personal reasons. I've already cleared it with the Chairman. Just think of it as a favor to your senior, okay?"

I wasn't the one to make that call; ask our Captain, he was right in front of you.

"Okay?"

I repeated it to Owl. He was stunned for a moment, then tilted his head and said to me, "Are you... being that... rash? Not even going to... discuss it with the team...?"

He was right; I was a member of the **Free Birds**, and I should prioritize the team's interests.

So I flatly refused her: "Senior Snake, as you can see, our Captain... and everyone else, seem quite reluctant. Besides, compared to yours, our strength is like children playing house. Could you perhaps find someone more capable?"

Normally, a senior who was thick-skinned enough to hear such a rejection would have backed off and withdrawn their unreasonable request. Snake did exactly that, leaving me with plenty of face—but another senior on the other side didn't seem to feel the same way.

"Don't go looking for anyone else."

Owl interrupted me just in time, stepping forward and whispering into my ear, "It's not every day a job walks in the door. Opportunities are for seizing; everything can be discussed."

With that, he turned back to Snake and began to persuade her: "Truly, wait for us a moment while we discuss our plans internally. We'll see if everyone has enough free time. If it's all good, it's no problem—the **Free Birds** are happy to serve you."

So this was what he meant by "discussing"? I have to say, Owl, I'm looking at you in a new light again.

As I said, he's the Captain, so he makes the calls; my opinion was just my own. I, of course, had no problem—I was always free. So while they were discussing, I asked Snake, "Senior, I just heard you mention crossing the sea... where are you going?"

"The aquatic guild, **Atlantis**."

"Is it for something special?"

"Not particularly," she said. "It's just a **Pukumon** who wants to go there to propose to someone. I don't know what he did before, but he's very unpopular there—they're ready to draw blades at a moment's notice. I felt sorry for him, so I took the request."

She truly was a kind person, completely unlike what her name suggested.

"Is it dangerous?"

"Depends on who you ask," Snake explained. "Pukumon is a Virus-type, and he's most afraid of the 'Vaccines' in the water making trouble and ruining his chances. This senior is only one person and can't swim, so my heart is willing but my strength is lacking."

I'd had enough of her excuses—it was beyond reason. At the same time, I found it hard to understand what benefit she got from being so transparently petty and calculating. I only hoped this wouldn't be another life-risking mission, or the **Free Birds** would have to risk it all again to fly free and find the meaning of survival.

## Gaiden 2: Abnormal Party Crusade

## (I)

### -By Red-

I am Red. My real name is Red; I despise fictional names.

In the Atrium system, every guild has its own elite frontrunners. Their strength isn't necessarily the highest, but the roles they play are certainly the most vital, second only to the guild's Chairman. In the **Holy Knights**, this position is occupied by us, the "**Red and Blue**" duo. The other guy is Blue—don't worry, he'll show up in the next part to say hello.

Some people think our personalities are mismatched. I don't blame them; you can see it just from our names. Furthermore, I am the Regional Operations Director for Coca-Cola, while he is the Regional Operations Manager for the competitor, Pepsi. I won't disclose exactly which regions. If someone said we were as close as brothers during our daily lives, almost no one would believe them.

The relationship we present to others is that of partners, friends, rivals, and market competitors. Thus, the missions we receive are also bound together, as the Chairman says it's "safer" that way. As if I didn't know—he actually does it to save on paying a second person for a job that requires two. If we couldn't even figure that out, we might as well quit being regional operations directors and go back to drinking a bottle of Coke.

That day, I had just reached my office, and my seat wasn't even warm yet, when I received a barrage of frantic messages from the Guild Chairman. One after another, the content of each message was basically the same: urging me to log on and take a job.

I asked him, "Don't you have anything else to do all day? Don't you need a life?"

He answered me point-blank, "What could a fishing enthusiast have to do? Every day I set up my rod and log on. My wife watches it for me, and when I come back, I even get to eat grilled fish..."

If you're going to talk, talk. Why suddenly brag in the middle of it? What's so great about having a wife?

I frowned and told him, "Tell me what it's about first. I'll see if I can make some time to evaporate from the human world for a bit."

"You know about the **Abnormal Party**, right?"

"What party?"

I was sure I hadn't misheard.

"Abnormal. You didn't mishear—abnormal. As the name suggests, it's a club formed by 'abnormals.' The club leader is a well-known 'Lust' female rogue, an alluring tramp. She loves taking her group of 'abnormals' into the Digital World to harass anyone with a decent appearance, acting as stalkers and flashers. Their targets are always people with a hint of sexiness. Apparently, they've been making quite a stir lately, and the higher-ups told me to send someone to clean them up. So I found you. No problem, right?"

Of course there was a problem.

I wasn't polite with him either and asked directly, "Where do you get the confidence that our 'Red and Blue' duo can handle this?"

"Well, you are the guild's representatives. If not you, then who else?"

"Why don't you go yourself?"

He laughed a few times and stated calmly, "If I go, who's going to manage the guild's affairs? Think about it—I even offloaded a mission to transport Belphemon to another guild. Do you think I'd have time to deal with a third-rate club? Wake up; I'm not that free."

So that Belphemon matter was his doing.

I knew it. How could a sleeping Demon Lord-type Digimon appear in the **Nature Court**'s territory for no reason? Someone definitely offloaded it on purpose. Passing the troubles assigned from above to others—that's his usual style. I'd long since ceased to be surprised by it.

"How long will this take, roughly?"

"For you two, I estimate no more than two days (two minutes). By the way, I've already notified Blue. He'll be waiting for you at the rendezvous point. I'll send you the specific coordinates later. I wish you a swift resolution and a triumphant return. That is all."

The messages from his end stopped. I hadn't even said I was free. Dammit, played again. Now I'd have to find a chance to take my equipment to the restroom.

I made sure the restroom door was locked from the inside and clicked on the left to successfully log in.

After passing through the Atrium public area and reaching the fire-wall, I looked up and saw a **Garudamon** returning from outside. Passing through the fire-wall, it turned into an old acquaintance of mine. His name is **Heath**, my drinking buddy and the president of the **Birdramon Commune**. He spends all day leading a bunch of **Birdramon** on patrols in the Digital World. He rescues people in distress and helps Digimon in danger. In short, he carries out the concept of "chivalry" to the end, and he has the best reputation in the entire Atrium system.

"Yo, look who it is—the daring truant Red."

He walked over and high-fived me, then gave my rear a smack. "Next time, you're buying the drinks. Pay back the money you owe me from last time! The boss recently hired a new bartender; I want the most expensive one!"

"Whatever you want, but I'm only ordering one glass."

Equal to a 330ml volume, a single glass of the cheapest wine in the entire bar costs more than twenty-three cans of Coca-Cola. It's hard not to admit that Chairman Adam is a shark.

After parting ways with him, I rushed to the designated location to meet up with Blue. When I arrived, I found he had already taken the form of **UlforceV-dramon** and charged alone into the **Abnormal Party**'s venue (stronghold), enjoying himself thoroughly. Specifically, he was sweeping up all the **Etemon** who were in a state of revelry. He drew the **Ulforce Saber** from his V-Bracelets to send the **Kinkakumon** and **Ginkakumon** who dared to block him away with one stroke, while also using **Shining V-Force** to take out a portion of the **WaruMonzaemon** he had knocked out earlier.

"—**Final Elysion**!"

I helped him clean up a portion of the **Gryzmon** who were planning to escape, as well as a group of **Gerbemon** who were attempting to fire **Poop Bazookas** at him.

"You're late."

The moment we met, he displayed such an attitude, as if I owed him something.

I told him helplessly, "I have to control the time I spend in the restroom so a cleaner doesn't find the stall empty but still locked from the inside and think it's haunted."

"Do you usually squat or sit?"

"Don't talk nonsense; toilets were invented to be sat on... You squat?"

"Yeah. My legs get numb if I squat too long."

"Ha, same if you sit too long."

The topic suddenly took a strange turn, but fortunately, we both realized it at the same time.

Following the dilapidated castle all the way deep inside, we encountered **Devidramon**—killed them. We met **Phantomon**—killed them. We met **Nanimon**—still killed them. You ask why there are no details? I'll tell you: a **Vanguard** doesn't need a process, only a result. Because the process lasts only a split second—too fast to describe in words.

Along the way, we saw many people who had been kidnapped by these abnormals and brought here. There were men and women, all given new appearances. Seeing "suggestive" outfits on Digimon felt more than a little jarring.

He reminded me, "Focus. Don't let your eyes wander."

I was speechless. "Didn't you look too? And so closely... Hey, I'm talking to you, give me a response."

See? This guy is narrow-minded and extremely hypocritical. Let me give a simple example: when going to the cinema to watch a movie, you usually buy popcorn and a drink at the counter. The price is usually a bit higher than what's sold outside. If the drink he buys is under the Coca-Cola company, he'll be miserable all day. Conversely, if it's from Pepsi, he thinks it's worth it no matter how expensive. So I feel like sometimes he just targets me on purpose—no reason, no purpose, just to vent, for the thrill of it.

Coming to a fork in the path further ahead, it split into two directions: one going up, leading directly to the castle's rooftop, and one going down, leading to the castle's dungeon. He had wings, so he naturally went up. I couldn't fly, so I automatically went down. Throughout the entire process, there was no verbal exchange—that's what you call a silent understanding.

The pitch-black underground space was vast and slippery, so I slowed down my pace. Soon, I discovered a figure hiding in the darkness—he wore a crown on his head and wrapped his body in a cape. He appeared to be a **KingEtemon**. Something was glowing behind his cape, flashing rhythmically, and he was humming a strange melody as if preparing something. Every now and then, he would chuckle to himself, letting out a few sinister laughs that made one's spine tingle.

I asked him, "What are you alone in there laughing about?"

"Hee hee hee," he chuckled. "Preparing a meeting gift for you."

With that, he suddenly threw open his cape, and subsequently, the entire underground illuminated with colored lights he had pre-arranged. The scene was entirely like a party venue; he was the host, and I was the only guest.

"Let us welcome today's VIP with a warm round of applause: Dukemon—!"

He showed off the character for "Great King" on his chest. Accompanied by music that sounded like noise, the atmosphere failed to heat up at all, perhaps due to my cold indifference. Affected by this, he became less calm, gritting his teeth in frustration and casually sending out a gift tailored for me—his ultimate move.

"—**Photon Blocker**!"

The glowing sphere hit my shield, and absolutely nothing happened. The scene instantly became very awkward.

At this, I huffed coldly and said, "Is that it?"

He then extended a finger and wagged it in front of my eyes. "NO, NO, NO. This is just the foreplay. The good stuff is yet to come. For example... hee hee... see the environment here? There's a breach!—**King Monkey Kick**!"

Taking a step to the left and holding up my shield, I smoothly and easily avoided it.

"Ah... this..."

Dammit, how did I let him speak first this time? This shouldn't be happening.

In front of him, I offered my mockery, asking, "Don't you have that kind of extremely powerful skill that can stir up a person's tension and make them deal with you seriously?"

He pretended to think for a moment and then answered, "I do. For example, now..."

He bared his teeth at me, and still, absolutely nothing happened. Never mind him; even I felt embarrassed for him. If there were a crack in the ground right now, I guarantee the first one to dive into it wouldn't be him, but me.

What a joke.

"Ah, I've had enough!" I, the competent audience member, couldn't help but complain. "You waste, '**performing a monkey show**' is for you to play others, not for you to act as the monkey yourself and play with yourself. Go to hell!"

Thrusting out the lance in my right hand, I initiated **Royal Saber**. He stood there, not even dodging, and obediently let me pierce his chest. He turned into a mass of data residue and vanished forever from this world.

So, what exactly was I expecting?

The Boss (He) wants me to crusade against the **Abnormal Party**. I'll go.

I walked into the company's data server room, swiped my card to enter, turned around to close the door, and made sure it was locked from the inside. I took the equipment out of my backpack and plugged it in, then clicked the button on the left to login to the Atrium system.

Passing through the fire-wall and arriving at the rendezvous point, I imagined myself as a wooden post, standing in front of the castle gate for nearly two hours. The red guy never showed up. During that time, three groups of people entered the castle, each with a bountiful harvest. The prey they caught were all humanoid living Digimon, with a balanced ratio of males and females, all with quite good figures.

At first, I was even thinking: *don't these guys get tired of eating this stuff all day?* Then a **Nanomon** came over to pick a fight with me: "Hey, you! Who are you!? Private property, no trespassing!"

"I'm waiting for someone."

"Waiting? For who? Do I know them?"

"Probably not," I answered honestly. "He should be here any second. When you see him, you'll know if you recognize him."

Later, he harassed me for a while, insisting I leave. He didn't think about how that could be possible—the mission wasn't finished, the other teammate hadn't arrived, and he wanted me to go away? No way.

"I see you're refusing a toast only to drink a forfeit..."

I found him annoying, so I drew the sword from my bracelet and gave a light swing. He was cut into two pieces and vanished with the wind as ash.

"Whew, finally some peace and quiet."

Hardly had I spoken when someone happened to come out of the castle and witnessed this scene, standing there stunned. I turned my head and looked carefully; it was an **Insekimon**.

Seeing his resemblance to **Gotsumon**, I called out to him and asked, "What's your relation to Gotsumon?"

"I don't know!" He shuddered, then turned back, pushed open the castle gate, and ran inside at full speed, screaming as he went: "Nanomon is dead! Someone come quick—someone's looking for trouble at the door!"

Afterward, a group of **Myotismon** and **Volcamon** burst out of the castle, one by one looking aggressive, saying they were going to skin me and smash my armor to avenge their comrades. I was deeply moved by the camaraderie they displayed, so I held back a bit and didn't use my best speed. Yet they still died—it was quite ridiculous.

"What's going on?" I was puzzled on the spot. "Why is everyone targeting me today? Looks like I'll have to let that guy share some of the burden later. Good, it's decided."

After a while, the Guild Boss connected with me and asked, "Blue, I just caught a glimpse of your location. What are you doing standing in front of that castle gate alone?"

"Waiting for Red."

"You're in the wrong place."

"The location you gave me is here; it's correct."

"Yes, the location is there, but—that's the enemy's stronghold."

Holy crap! I knew there was a reason they were all targeting me—it turned out I had exposed myself. My bad, my bad.

In case he couldn't find me later, I asked the Boss about the situation: "Why hasn't Red arrived yet?"

"I just got in touch with him. He should be there any second. Wait a bit longer."

"No," I told him. "I have things to do."

"What things?"

"Purging."

With that, I raised the light sword in my hand, sliced open the castle gate, and drifted inside, starting an indiscriminate massacre of the inhabitants.

No one was innocent. No one could leave alive to tell this tale—especially not to Red. No one. As for the Boss, he's the type to forget once he's said it, and besides, it's not a big matter; he won't take it to heart. So there was no need to worry—it's never too late to kill after speaking out.

Then, what happened in the previous part occurred. Red went to the dungeon, and I went to the rooftop.

The path to the rooftop was clear. Arriving at a bell tower, a **Piemon** suddenly hopped out, balancing on a ball and moving nimbly, showing off his exquisite balance.

"Do you want to die?" I asked him.

"I don't," he answered unhurriedly.

"Then get off that thing. Stop dancing around in front of me."

Saying this, I kicked his ball away. He made a powerful leap, flipping over my head and casually throwing down a white cloth, just big enough to cover my body.

He naively thought I would do nothing, just stand there and let the cloth cover me, then turn into a keychain hanging at his waist. Of course I wouldn't let him succeed, and it was hard for him anyway, because I had already activated **Ulforce**. That cloth's falling speed in my eyes was comparable to a snail on the ground—the time was ridiculously long. I even had time to pinch the four corners and re-fold it into a new shape, then place it under his feet as a stepping stone before he landed. Afterward, I ran back to my original spot, making him think I had been stationary all along.

"You—"

Seeing that I hadn't disappeared and that the cloth, now folded into a flower shape, was under his feet, the look on his contorted face was beyond hilarious.

"The clown is always the one being played," I told him. "If you want to cry, just cry. I'll wipe your tears for you."

"Aaaarrgh—!"

He was furious. He drew the four swords from his back and threw them at me.

"—**Trump Sword**!"

Similarly, the speed of the four swords was very slow—slow enough that his juggling couldn't be fully utilized. He originally wanted to make it impossible for me to find the correct direction they were coming from, but to me, their disappearance was just them turning transparent.

If I were to expose his trick to his face, he might cry himself to death, so I made preparations in advance. I kindly picked up that cloth from earlier, wiped all four swords clean, and then tied the four corners of the cloth to the hilts of the four swords. I moved the whole assembly directly above his head, allowing it to drop. As it fell, I raised the sword in my hand, sliced through his waist, and sent him on his final journey.

After resolving it, Red rushed up from below to meet me. He told me it was strange—KingEtemon had done absolutely nothing and just stood there frozen. He had just charged in with his lance and finished the guy.

I thought about it and asked him, "Don't you know there's something called network latency?"

"I know, but dammit, that was too slow!"

"It's not that he was slow; it's that our network is too good."

"Fair enough."

"Pepsi's network department has always been reliable."

"Our Coke's isn't bad either."

Then we both put on a face that said we wanted to kill each other, but aimed our weapons behind us. There was a bitch trying to sneak attack us from behind, but unfortunately, we had noticed her long ago.

"Just like the intelligence said," Red raised his voice on purpose. "The club leader of the **Abnormal Party**, **Lilithmon**, an alluring tramp."

"Hahaha," she let out a laugh at both of us like a maniac. "Calling me alluring, hmm... I admit it. After all, a person is beautiful like this all their life. Calling me a tramp, hmm... you're the tramp! Your whole family are tramps!"

Her sudden change of face caught us off guard.

Red sighed and leaned in close to me without an expression, asking, "We both just got insulted by a tramp. I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now. What do you say?"

What else could be done? The old way.

"As if I'm comfortable," I told Red. "Say no more. Beat her."

We agreed instantly, but the next second, the opponent immediately chickened out.

"Wait, you... don't come over yet!"

Too late. My fist had already swung out and had already touched her face. Her feet were off the ground, and she'd likely fall from the rooftop platform to the ground in a few seconds. If she was lucky, her face wouldn't be ruined.

"What are you in such a hurry for?" Red asked me helplessly. "The new drink reception at the **The 'Drink' Bar** doesn't start for another seven hours. Going now, you won't even get a seat. Just give up."

What? The new drink reception is today? How could I be so uninformed?

"The old rule," he suggested. "Whoever takes her down last doesn't pay tonight; the other one treats."

"Then I'd better hurry."

"Don't worry, I haven't called start yet. Three, two, one... Start!"

What's the difference? I'm already ahead!

"DO—NOT—ACTIVATE—ULFORCE—"

The time it took him to say those words was too long—long enough for me to vault over the castle wall first, spread my wings and fly down, reaching Lilithmon's side. First, I cut off her right **Nazar Nail** that could corrode anything, then I tied her wings in a knot, helped her tidy her messy hair, and finally moved her over the nearby lake, waiting for her to fall into the water.

After waiting by the lake for a while, I finally saw Red.

"Yo, you're here."

"Why did you run so fast?" he said, panting. "Where is she?"

I turned my head and glanced at the bubbling lake surface. "Bathing. No peeking."

"And yet you're looking?"

"I have a taste for it."

"No way," his eyes widened. "You like her type?"

I nodded and told him, "Everyone has their hobbies."

"Eww... hobbies. I'd say 'abnormal' is more like it."

"An abnormal resolving an abnormal—I'd say it's just right."

"Fair enough." He leaned against a tree and asked me, "When do you plan to save her?"

"Not saving her."

"Why? Didn't you just say you like her? Turning your back so soon?"

"Not that." I answered him. "I just accidentally let my 'abnormal' side out. I wanted to see if a Digimon can drown in water. Look, she's still struggling, but she's almost..."

The words had hardly left my mouth when suddenly, an **Ouryumon** burst out of the lake, swallowed her whole, and then dived back to the bottom with satisfaction. Before leaving, it even turned toward us and let out a burp like a clap of thunder, thanking us for the feeding.

"This—"

"This... is it over?"

We said it in unison. Neither of us gave the other a reply; we just stood there, staring at the lake surface, hoping to see a flower bloom or something. After a while, Red broke the silence:

"I don't know why, but I suddenly feel like drinking."

I cast a vote of approval. "Old place, old specifications?"

"Let's go!"

We agreed once more and turned toward the **The 'Drink' Bar**. After greeting Red's old friend Heath and exchanging a few words, we learned there were no seats left. We had to find two empty barrels from the warehouse in the back to sit on.

"What'll the two **Vanguards** have today?"

The boss greeted us warmly and recommended we try the new style mixed by the new bartender. For no other reason than that the drink mixed by the newcomer wasn't very expensive, and I'd been drinking the old specification for a long time anyway—it was time for a change of flavor.

"Here it is: the latest style, the 'Super Big Crayon'. Remember to stir it before drinking for a better taste. Enjoy."

It was a relatively expensive drink, with a slightly deep color—between brown and orange-red. It looked like coffee but wasn't coffee; it was bubbling inside, and the taste was very familiar.

"Don't you think..."

"Yeah, I have the same feeling."

A silent understanding is what builds rapport.

I asked the boss, "Excuse me, what are the ingredients for this drink?"

He answered with a single word that instantly unsettled us both.

"Cola."

"WHAT BRAND!?"

We both asked this question very loudly, making the noisy bar go silent for two or three seconds before it resumed its normalcy. Adding a few laughs to the rowdy crowd was exactly what we should do.

"You guys... seriously."

The boss leaned in with a look like he was concerned for idiots and told us grumpily, "Dr. Pepper. What, you have a problem?"

No problem. Just felt a bit of a pity. We both felt that way. Between "Red and Blue," there was never a need for verbal communication; everything was understood without words.
