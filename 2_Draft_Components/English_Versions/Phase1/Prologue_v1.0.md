# Prologue: The Raiders

Humanity’s quest to explore the Digital World knows no end.

In the physical world, the network is the lifeblood of existence. But a network requires maintenance; maintenance demands the detection of flaws, and flaws demand resolution. Such is the cycle of human necessity. Yet, identifying these fissures is no simple feat. The digital realm is far more intricate than we dare imagine—lacking physical substance, its most critical clues often elude the naked eye, spiraling into lethal catastrophes. Even with our mastery over code, we cannot wait for data to self-correct. Human intervention remains our only true safeguard.

Then, one day, an esteemed academic proposed a radical hypothesis: If every digital event is a reflection of local reality, why not strike at the root? By plunging directly into the Digital World to uproot the cause, wouldn't the glitches in our physical realm dissolve of their own accord?

I countered him immediately. "How do you know the intruder won't become the next catastrophe? If our presence adds unnecessary strain to that space—forget whether the original glitch can even be localized—whether your agent can even survive the return is a gamble. To say nothing of the ripple effects that would follow."

After a grueling debate, the consensus sided with him. They argued we must look toward the future; that while risks were inevitable, they were obstacles meant to be overcome.

Five years later, Midgard rose.

Ten years later, the EDEN sensory immersion rigs became a household standard.

And then, the world finally tasted the cruelty of the Digital World—especially in those uncharted territories beyond human reach. To die there was to be shredded into raw data, leaving nothing behind.

From alpha tests to open beta, and finally to full operation, I bore witness to the birth of the Guilds. I watched as wave after wave of pioneers breached the network firewalls, assuming the forms of Digimon only to march toward their deaths on the far side. Many vanished without a whisper. A part of me believes I failed them—that their silence is a burden I must carry. Perhaps if I had won that debate years ago, there would be more happy families in this world today.

Perhaps this entire endeavor was a mistake from the beginning—a problem in its own right. And so, I became the one to solve it.

I founded **The Raiders**.

They were drafted by nation-state, elected from the elite of the major Guilds. The minimum requirement for entry was the Mega Level. Guild Leaders were excluded, for a flock of dragons must never be without its head. Through rigorous multi-layered screenings, each nation selected a single representative for The Raiders. This was done for two reasons: equity and security.

Before every excursion into the unknown, I sought their consent. Or more accurately, I sought the blessing of their superiors. If their governments deemed them expendable, I had no voice to object.

With every raid, I tasked them with retrieving data samples. These allowed me to analyze the environment, construct predictive topographical models, and assess threat levels to ensure the next party’s survival.

To date, twenty nations have joined the cause. Within the unit, two factions have already emerged: The "U.N. Big Five" and the "Nordic Five." I was told this was the will of their respective governments. I had no power to interfere, nor the desire to. In truth, I found it fitting. To brave the abyss with comrades bound by absolute trust—it was a dream I once held myself. They realized it for me, and their results have been nothing short of extraordinary.

These small units operate in teams of five, fulfilling specific roles: **Vanguard, Support, Striker, Defender, and Backup.** Their coordination is surgical, and so far, every mission has proceeded without a hitch.

That is all I can share for now. Indeed, that is all they permit me to say.

Oh, one last thing. Before they departed, they asked me to leave a message for everyone logging in for the first time:

**"Welcome to the Digital World."**
