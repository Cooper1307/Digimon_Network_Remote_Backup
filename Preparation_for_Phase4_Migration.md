# USER Objective:
Execute Phase 4: Chapters 6, 7, 8, and Gaiden 2 Automation

The user's main objective is to automate the processing of Phase 4 of the "Digital Monster Network" project. This phase covers Chapters 6, 7, 8 and Gaiden 2. This involves applying the AIE v3.0 protocols, maintaining "Tone Sovereignty" (Mature/Adult/Dark Fantasy), and ensuring "Logic Consistency."

# Previous Session Summary (Phase 3 Closure & Phase 4 Initialization):
Phase 3 (Chapters 3, 4, 5, Gaiden 1) has been officially SEALED and ARCHIVED. 
Phase 4 has been pre-initialized with the following:
1.  **Database Migration**: `Database_Phase4_v1.0.md` has been created, inheriting lore from Phase 3 and adding new entries for the "Demon King" (Belphemon) and "Guild Quadrille."
2.  **MTPE Analysis**: Analysis files for Chapters 6, 7, 8 and Gaiden 2 have been created in `MTPE/Phase4/`.
3.  **Structural Integrity**: Verified all project files and directories are aligned.

# Next Steps:
1.  **Process Phase 4 Chapters**: 
    - Execute Module C (Refined Translation) and Module D (Clean Export) for:
      - Chapter 6: The Chairman's Request (会长的请求)
      - Chapter 7: The Resurrected Demon King (复苏的魔王)
      - Chapter 8: Mother's Testament (母亲的遗嘱)
      - Gaiden 2: Abnormal Party Crusade (变态派对讨伐战)
2.  **Finalize Phase 4**:
    - Update `task.md` and `AIE_Project_Edit_Log_v1.0.md`.
    - Generate `Final_Export_Phase4_Consolidated_v1.0.md`.
    - Create a final `walkthrough.md`.

Please proceed directly to the translation of Chapter 6 using the already prepared analysis in `MTPE/Phase4/MTPE_Analysis_Ch6_v1.0.md`.
