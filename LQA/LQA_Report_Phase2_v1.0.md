# AIE LQA Report: Phase 2 Automation v1.0

## 1. Audit Overview

Phase 2 automation covered the transition of Sakura (Rosemon) into the "Midgard" hubs and her encounter with Owl and Adam. (Remaining Phase 3 chapters re-aligned).

## 2. Notable Tone Decisions

- **Adam (HerculesKabuterimon):** Styled as a "Cynical Information Broker." Use of French-influenced English structure (e.g., "Busted, I suppose") to reflect his Parisian background.
- **Dragon (Dorugoramon):** Characterized by "Power Sovereignty." His dialogue uses a Master/Disciple (Sifu) hierarchy, translated to maintain the cultural nuance while keeping the dark tone.
- **Mature Content Audit:** The "Pervert Party" (变态派对) and "Ofanimon: Falldown Mode" (坠落形态) sections were handled with clinical precision to avoid over-sensationalism while preserving the psychological weight of the "Dark Fantasy" setting.

## 3. Terminology Alignment Table

| Source | Target Decision | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **体验勋章** | **Trial Badge** | Reflects the "Trial/Human Experience" status. |
| **反编译** | **Decompilation** | Technical term for the loss of human state. |
| **喝一杯酒吧** | **Drink a Cup Bar** | Literal but stylized as a sanctuary hub. |
| **多路喧嚣** | **Multi-Discordance** | Custom skill name to evoke overwhelming chaos. |

## 4. Conclusion

Phase 2 is verified as complete. Terminology is locked into the global database. No further edits required.
